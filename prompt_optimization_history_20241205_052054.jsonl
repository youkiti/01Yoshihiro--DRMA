We will not apply language or country restrictions. We will include all papers including published, unpublished articles, abstracts of conferences, and letters. We will exclude randomized cross-over or case series studies. We will not exclude studies based on the observation period or publication year.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudy\nSince we are interested in the association between the amount of transfusion and the acquirement of infection in critically ill patients, we will include studies to evaluate the transfusion for critically ill patients.\n\nAdditionally, since it has reached no consensus whether erythropoietin and iron supplementation affect infection in critically ill patients [4], we will also collect the amounts of transfusion reported in these studies. Whilst, in studies for pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will exclude vitamin D since vitamin D may inhibit sepsis in critically ill patients [5]. For the search for studies of pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will use the search strategies for the systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the hierarchy of monotherapy and combination therapy to reduce RBC transfusion for patients in the ICU [4].\n\nPopulation\n\nWe will include critically ill adult patients with hemodynamically stable, who are admitted to the ICU. Elective surgical patients and burn patients will be excluded.\n\nIntervention\nTo evaluate dose-response relationships, it needs that there is the difference of the amount of transfusion between the arms of these studies. Such interventions will be two or more different fixed doses of transfusion within a study and include the no-transfusion group that the amount of transfusion is 0 unit.\n\n\nOutcome\nIncidence of infection\nWe defined the incidence of infection as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are infections acquired in hospitals where critically ill patients are admitted and newly developed apart from the underlying disease [6]. HAIs cover bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, not parasitic [7]. We will measure the number of patients with HAIs during hospitalization. If the HAIs are not reported, we will collect the ICU-acquired infection. The collected data prioritizes pre-defined infection in each eligible study. In addition, we will collect the category of infection by the following hierarchy: i) Sepsis/Septic shock, ii) Bacteremia, iii) Any infection collected by the original authors.\n\n", "analysis": "The prompt is overly exclusionary, as it misses relevant studies that should be included according to the specified criteria.

In this quality improvement intervention we assessed the effect of an institutional protocol and computerized decision support for red cell transfusion in the critically ill. DESIGN: We compared processes of care and outcomes during the two 3-month periods before and after the introduction of a multidisciplinary quality improvement intervention. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care units--medical, surgical, and mixed--in a tertiary academic center. PATIENTS: Consecutive critically ill patients with anemia (hemoglobin of <10 g/dL).

The main outcome measures were number of transfusions, proportion of patients who were transfused outside evidence-based indications, transfusion complications, and adjusted hospital mortality. The mean number of red cell transfusions per intensive care unit admission decreased from 1.08 +/- 2.3 units before to 0.86 +/- 2.3 units after the protocol (p<.001). We observed a marked decrease in the percentage of patients receiving inappropriate transfusions (17.7% vs. 4.5%, p< .001).

Adverse effects of FFP have been well described, including acute lung injury. However, it is also suggested that a higher amount of FFP decreases mortality in trauma patients requiring a massive transfusion. Furthermore, FFP has an endothelial stabilizing effect in experimental models. We investigated the effect of fresh frozen plasma transfusion on systemic inflammation and endothelial condition. METHODS: A prospective predefined substudy of a randomized trial in coagulopathic non-bleeding critically ill patients receiving a prophylactic transfusion of FFP (12 ml/kg) prior to an invasive procedure. Levels of inflammatory cytokines and markers of endothelial condition were measured in paired samples of 33 patients before and after transfusion. The statistical tests used were paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: At baseline, systemic cytokine levels were mildly elevated in critically ill patients. FFP transfusion resulted in a decrease of levels of TNF-α (from 11.3 to 2.3 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Other cytokines were not affected. FFP also resulted in a decrease in systemic syndecan-1 levels (from 675 to 565 pg/ml, P = 0.01) and a decrease in factor VIII levels (from 246 to 246%, P <0.01), suggestive of an improved endothelial condition. This was associated with an increase in ADAMTS13 levels (from 24 to 32%, P <0.01) and a concomitant decrease in von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels (from 474 to 423%, P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A fixed dose of FFP transfusion in critically ill patients decreases syndecan-1 and factor VIII levels, suggesting a stabilized endothelial condition, possibly by increasing ADAMTS13, which is capable of cleaving vWF.
