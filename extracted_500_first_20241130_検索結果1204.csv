Mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to post-resuscitative brain damage are unknown. In recent years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have emerged as a central player in inflammation, thrombogenesis and cardiovascular disease. NETs are chromatin fibers consisting of histones, cell free DNA (cfDNA) and granular proteins and are released within minutes (1) to hours (2) following activation by various stimuli including ischemia and reperfusion (3). While NETs have primarily been recognized as mediators of antimicrobial host defense, they may exert detrimental inflammatory and procoagulant effects causing endothelial damage, platelet activation, microvessel occlusions and ultimately tissue malperfusion (4). In particular neutrophil histones and DNA are considered cytotoxic and procoagulant components of NETs (5) and have been implicated in organ damage in various medical conditions (6). Despite this, the role of NETs in cardiac arrest has not yet been investigated. Proinflammatory and pro-thrombotic properties, however, render them possible mediators of neutrophil-borne brain injury after successful resuscitation. OBJECTIVES. We hypothesized that the formation of NETs in the early phase after successful resuscitation may be associated with neurologic impairment in cardiac arrest survivors. METHODS. This prospective cohort study included adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac etiology who received targeted temperature management. Plasma levels of specific (citrullinated histone H3, H3Cit) and putative (cell free DNA and nucleosomes) biomarkers of NET formation were assessed at 0 and 12 hours after admission and categorized into quintiles prior to analysis. The primary outcome variable of interest was the effect of H3Cit levels at 12 hours on 30-day neurologic function, assessed by logistic regression. Results are given as odds ratio (95% confidence interval). RESULTS. Between January 2014 and January 2017 62 patients (79% male, median age: 57 years) were enrolled at the Emergency Department at the Medical University of Vienna. In total, 52% of patients (n=32) had a poor 30-day neurologic function. The odds of neurologic impairment linearly increased with 12-hour levels of H3Cit (1.6, 1.1-2.3; p=0.029) and were highest in patients in the fifth quintile of the histone level distribution (9, 1.3-63; p=0.027). The effect remained unchanged after bivariate adjustment for covariables. CONCLUSION. Increased plasma levels of H3Cit 12 hours after successful resuscitation are associated with poor 30-day neurologic recovery in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with cardiac etiology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim is to evaluate whether early extubation influences short- and medium-term postoperative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent OLT in a tertiary hospital in a period from January 2016 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1: early extubation in the intensive care unit and group 2: delayed extubation. Mortality is compared between both groups in the first month and first and third year. Postoperative morbidity was also compared. Results: Patients in group 1 (n = 165, 79.9%) presented, with statistical significance, lower mortality at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years; shorter duration of admission to the critical care unit and of hospital stay; lower incidence of surgical reoperation and retransplant; lower rate of transfusion of blood products; fewer pulmonary, digestive, neurologic, cardiologic, hemodynamic, kidney, surgical, infectious, metabolic, thrombotic, vascular, and graft complications; less need for kidney replacement therapy; less refractory ascites; and greater infectious risk. However, no statistically significant differences were found in the need for hospital readmission; in biliary, endocrine, nutritional, hematologic, thrombotic, and hematologic complications; or in graft rejection. In group 1, 6.6% of patients required reintubation. In group 2, 97% of patients could be extubated during the first week; 7.8% required noninvasive mechanical ventilation type bilevel positive airway pressure and 8.1% high flow. Only 2.8% of patients required tracheotomy. Conclusions: The role of early extubation seems key to improve outcomes in OLT because it reduces the incidence of multiple complications and mortality, with low reintubation rates. It is a feasible and safe procedure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Forty-two rats were equally divided into 7 groups. The first and second groups were used as untreated and sham controls, respectively. The third (DEX4) and fourth (DEX40) groups received 4 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg DEX treatments. The fifth, sixth and seventh group were operated on to induce cerebral ischemia. The fifth, sixth and seventh groups are used to represent cerebral ischemia, cerebral ischemia + DEX4, and cerebral ischemia + DEX40, respectively. DEX was intraperitoneally given to the DEX groups at the 3rd, 24th and 48th hour. Brain and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels and plasma IL-1β and TNF-α levels were high in the cerebral ischemia group although they were low in the DEX4 and DEX40 groups. Decreased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and reduced glutathione (GSH) values in the brain and erythrocyte of the cerebral ischemia group were increased by the DEX treatments, although PARP, and the caspase 3 and 9 expressions in the brain were further decreased. Conversely, the cerebral ischemia-induced decrease in the liver vitamin A, vitamin E, GSH, and GSH-Px were further decreased by the DEX treatments, although MDA level, PARP, and caspase 3 and 9 expressions were further increased by the DEX treatments. In conclusion, DEX induced protective effects against cerebral ischemia-induced brain and erythrocyte oxidative injuries through regulation of the antioxidant level and cytokine production.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients in each group were equally matched in terms of age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality, and number with dengue hemorrhage fever grade IV, although the platelet counts were higher in the W group compared with the P group (geometric mean 42.2, confidence interval 36.9, 48.4 vs. geometric mean 36.7, confidence interval 33.3, 40.5, p < .05). Patients in the W group received less fluids in the first hour compared with the P group (median and interquartile range 20 mL/kg, 15 and 20 vs. 30 mL/kg, 20 and 60). Fluid was actively removed less often in the W group than the P group (6 of 111 vs. 45 of 96, p < .05). There was no difference in the need for ventilation or incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome between groups, although among dengue hemorrhage fever grade IV patients, the number requiring ventilation (17 of 30 vs. 20 of 23, p < .05) and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (9 of 30 vs. 17 of 23, p < .05) were significantly greater in the W group compared with the P group. The duration of ventilation (1.5 +/- 1.7 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.9 days, p < .05) and length of intensive care unit stay (3.0 +/- 2.8 vs. 3.4 +/- 2.9 days, p < .05) were significantly less in the W group. The pediatric intensive care unit mortality (16.6% vs. 6.3%, p < .05) was significantly higher in the W group than in the P group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dengue shock syndrome are at high risk of mortality due to refractory shock and multiple organ failure. Survival was better for patients in the P group. Aggressive shock management and possibly the use of judicious fluid removal may decrease mortality rates in the severest forms of dengue shock syndrome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: A nested case-control study using historical data was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Songklanagarind Hospital, Thailand. All very low birth weight (VLBW) infants delivered between November 2009 and July 2016 were enrolled. The infants were identified as RBC transfusion received and NEC developed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for transfusion and the association between RBC transfusion and NEC. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-four VLBW infants were enrolled in the study. The median (interquartile range) gestational age was 29 (27, 31) wk. The overall incidence of NEC was 13%. Three (5.2%) of the NEC infants had TANEC. The infants who received RBC transfusion had a lower gestational age [odds ratio, OR 0.64; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.57, 0.73, p < 0.001] and were more likely to have pneumonia (OR 9.86; 95%CI 5.02, 19.35, p < 0.001) or to have received H(2) blocker (OR 2.92; 95%CI 1.73, 4.93, p < 0.001).

Therefore, we sought to evaluate the factors associated with deaths in the context of severe malnutrition and also the effects of early, i.e., within 3 hours of diagnosing septic shock vs. late blood transfusion. METHODOLOGY: Here, all under-five severely malnourished septic shock children were admitted to ICU during 2013-2017. Children who died constituted cases (n = 54), and the survived (n = 39) represented controls. We excluded children who received the blood transfusion for other causes and who left against medical advice. RESULTS: In both descriptive and multivariate analysis, we found that death was significantly associated with the use of fourth-line antibiotics, corticosteroids, and the addition of vasopressors on top of dopamine (all p < 0.05). However, the decrease of serum calcium level was found significantly associated with death only after adjusting (p < 0.05). Even though the cases more often received early blood transfusion than the controls, the difference was insignificant (p = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: When a severely malnourished under-five child develops septic shock, requiring vasopressors, fourth-line antibiotic, and corticosteroid, with reduced serum calcium, the probability of death increases significantly. Our findings underscore the gravity of close monitoring at these points and the niches for early interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHOD: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected database at a local trauma center. Hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients received treatment according to our hospital protocol during two different time periods. Before June 2008, these patients underwent early angiography (ANGIO group, n = 13), and from June 2008 onward, these patients underwent early pelvic packing and subsequent angiography if there was continued hemorrhage from the pelvis (PACKING group, n = 11). The mechanism of injury, physiologic parameters, blood transfusion requirements, time to intervention, trauma scores, and mortality were recorded. Results: Mean time to intervention in the ANGIO group was longer than that in the PACKING group, although this was not statistically significant (139.5 minutes vs. 78.8 minutes, respectively, p = 0.248). Mortality in the ANGIO group was higher than that in the PACKING group; however, this was also not significant (69.2% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.107). After univariate analysis, factors associated with mortality included systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Score, Injury Severity Score, Revised Trauma Score, Trauma and Injury Severity Score, pH, and base excess. In the PACKING group, one patient died of uncontrolled hemorrhage from a liver laceration. In the ANGIO group, three patients died of uncontrolled hemorrhage from the pelvic fracture. Conclusion: Early experience in our institution suggests that early pelvic packing with subsequent angiography if needed is as good as angiography with embolization in treating patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional case-control series reviewed all low birth weight (LBW, 2000 g) neonates and/or neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age who had been hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from 2006 to 2010. The cohort was divided into infants without ROP (nonROP group) and infants with ROP (ROP group). Infants were first examined by a group of pediatric ophthalmologists 6 weeks after delivery, and then were followed every 1-2 weeks until death, discharge or complete retinal avascularization. If an infant developed ROP, further examinations were performed based on the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity Study protocol. Demographic data, medical treatment, and ophthalmic disorders were all statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 576 infants met the criteria for evaluation. Of 576 total patients, 183 infants (32%) (88 males, 95 females) had ROP. There were significant differences between groups in gestational age, body weight, and duration of oxygen administration, and sepsis (P<0.05). Male/female ratio, single and multiple births, and jaundice, phototherapy, and blood transfusion were not significant. The majority of ROP was stage I or II (137, 74.8%). Stage III or greater developed in 46 infants (25.1%) [Note: The ocular history and ocular outcomes are not risk factors.] Conclusions: The incidence of ROP in this study is higher than that in other parts of the world.

The traditional approach of flushing arterial lines with pressurised heparinised saline has been challenged in recent years by a number of studies which failed to show superiority over normal saline. This is whilst also keeping in mind that exposure to heparin may result in rare but potentially life-threatening complications (Aronson, 2006) and that normal saline actually incurs a cost benefit (Robertson- Malt, Malt, Farquhar and Greer, 2014). Objectives. The primary objective of this audit was to demonstrate that there was no statistically significant difference in the lifespan of arterial lines in our ICU if the flushing solution was changed from heparinised saline to normal saline; secondary objectives were to demonstrate that the arterial line flushing solution had no influence on complication rate, clotting values and platelet count. Methods. All patients included were over 18 years of age, were admitted to the ICU at Mater Dei Hospital, Malta and had an arterial line in-situ. The first set of data (collected between December 2017 and January 2018) consisted of patients whose arterial lines were flushed with heparinised saline, whereas the second set (collected between September 2019 and February 2020) included only patients whose lines were flushed with normal saline. All patients were assessed daily by a member of the data collection team; the data collected included demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, site of line placement, any line-related complications as well as daily APTT ratio and platelet count. Furthermore, 3 separate tests were performed daily to confirm line patency: • A 'fast-flush' test. • Easy aspiration of blood. • Invasive vs non-invasive blood pressure difference of less than 10 mmHg. Results. The first set of data included a total of 114 arterial lines, each of which stayed in-situ for an average of 3.9 days with an average functional day percentage of 23.9%. The second set of data included 20 lines which stayed in-situ for an average of 4.3 days with an average functional day percentage of 87%. The first and second sets of data were compared and found to be matched for all demographics with the exception of SOFA score; all numerical data was compared using a 2-sample T-Test with equal variances, whereas categorical data was compared using Pearson's chisquared test. The percentage of days during which the lines were found functional was compared across the 2 sets of data and no statistically significant difference was found (p-value > 0.05). No complications were recorded in either group and no statistically significant difference was found in average APTT ratio and platelet count between the 2 groups. Conclusion.

Clinical presentations vary widely and, in some cases, it is a dramatic life-threatening event. Case report: A 6 days-old girl admitted to intensive care unit with severe cardiogenic shock and metabolic acidosis. Mechanical ventilation was initiated and inotropic support administered due to low systolic function (shortening fraction = 20%). After initial improvement, severe arterial hypertension was evidenced (systolic pressure 50 mmHg above 95 percentile). She had no umbilical catheterization. Renal doppler was normal. Laboratory analysis showed low platelet count and a raised D-dimer. Technecium 99-MAG 3 renal scan showed a decrease in renal flow in the upper right kidney, although magnetic angioresonance was normal. Myocardial function and arterial pressure returned to normal after digital and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. After infections, low blood flow and anatomic causes were excluded, a believe that a perinatal microangiopathic event may lead to renal lesions with renovascular hypertension. Conclusion: Arterial hypertension must be included in the differential diagnosis of newborns with heart failure and acidosis, due to its severe clinical evolution and specific therapy. © 2006 Sociedad Chilena de Pediatr•br〉.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim of this study was to investigate the benefit–risk ratio of PT before cholecystectomy on the occurrence of postoperative VOE. Adult SCD patients who underwent cholecystectomy between 2008 and 2019 in our center were included. Patients’ characteristics, collected retrospectively, were compared according to PT. A total of 79 patients were included, 66% of whom received PT. Gallbladder histopathology found chronic cholecystitis (97%) and gallstones (66%). Transfused patients underwent more urgent surgeries and had experienced more painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in the month before surgery (p = 0.05). Four (8.5%) post-transfusion alloimmunizations occurred, and two of them caused a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) (4.3%). The occurrence of postoperative VOE was similar between the groups (19.2% vs. 29.6%, p = 0.45). Though not statistically significant, a history of hospitalized VOC within 6 months prior to surgery seemed to be associated to postoperative VOE among non-transfused patients (75% vs. 31.6%, p = 0.10). PT before cholecystectomy exposes to risks of alloimmunization and DHTR that could be avoided in some patients. Recent VOCs appear to be associated with a higher risk of postoperative VOE and prompt the preemptive transfusion of these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In the two groups which had been given AT III substitution the concentration of AT III rose considerably higher than the activity. There was a drop of the platelet count in both groups which had received heparin. C1 esterase inhibitor was diminished in the beginning but spontaneously increased in all groups. This increase was slowest in the group without substitution of AT III. The blood loss in cases of traumatic shock was considerably higher in the group which had received both substances. The consumption of AT III concentrates was slightly higher in the combined therapy group than in the AT III group. The duration of symptoms of DIC was considerably shorter in the two substituted groups than in the heparin group.

The prevalence of increased red cell distribution width and its significance in the intensive care unit are unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between red cell distribution width at the initiation of critical care and all cause mortality. DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Two tertiary academic hospitals in Boston, MA. PATIENTS: A total of 51,413 patients, aged ≥ 18 yrs, who received critical care between 1997 and 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The exposure of interest was red cell distribution width as a predictor of mortality in the general population. The prevalence of increased red cell distribution width and its significance in the intensive care unit are unknown and categorized a priori in quintiles as ≤ 13.3%, 13.3% to 14.0%, 14.0% to 14.7%, 14.7% to 15.8%, and >15.8%. Logistic regression examined death by days 30, 90, and 365 postcritical care initiation, inhospital mortality, and bloodstream infection. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models. Adjustment included age, sex, race, Deyo-Charlson index, coronary artery bypass grafting, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, hematocrit, white blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, blood urea nitrogen, red blood cell transfusion, sepsis, and creatinine. Red cell distribution width was a particularly strong predictor of all-cause mortality 30 days after critical care initiation with a significant risk gradient across red cell distribution width quintiles after multivariable adjustment: red cell distribution width 13.3% to 14.0% (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.30; p <.001); red cell distribution width 14.0% to 14.7% (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16-1.42; p <.001); red cell distribution width 14.7% to 15.8% (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.52-1.86; p <.001); red cell distribution width >15.8% (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.37-2.86; p <.001), all relative to patients with red cell distribution width ≤ 13.3%. Similar significant robust associations postmultivariable adjustments are seen with death by days 90 and 365 postcritical care initiation as well as inhospital mortality. In a subanalysis of patients with blood cultures drawn (n = 18,525), red cell distribution width at critical care initiation was associated with the risk of bloodstream infection and remained significant after multivariable adjustment. The adjusted risk of bloodstream infection was 1.40- and 1.44-fold higher in patients with red cell distribution width values in the 14.7% to 15.8% and >15.8% quintiles, respectively, compared with those with red cell distribution width ≤ 13.3%. Estimating the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve shows that red cell distribution width has moderate discriminative power for 30-day mortality (area under the curve = 0.67). CONCLUSION: Red cell distribution width is a robust predictor of the risk of all-cause patient mortality and bloodstream infection in the critically ill. Red cell distribution width is commonly measured, inexpensive, and widely available and may reflect overall inflammation, oxidative stress, or arterial underfilling in the critically ill.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Some infants may clinically deteriorate, requiring admission to an intensive care unit. We aimed to describe diagnostic and therapeutic measures of bronchiolitis in Israeli pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and evaluate intercenter variability of care. Methods: Medical records of all RSV-infected infants admitted to 5 Israeli PICUs over 4 RSV seasons were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Data on 276 infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis, admitted to the participating PICUs were analyzed. Most of the infants were males with a mean admission age of 4.7 months. Approximately half of the infants had pre-existing conditions such as prematurity, cardiac disease or chronic lung disease. Respiratory distress was the most common symptom at presentation followed by hypoxemia and fever. There was significant variation in the methods used for RSV diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support of the infants. Furthermore, utilization of inhalational therapy and transfusion of blood products differed significantly between the centers. Although a bacterial pathogen was isolated in only 13.4% of the infants, 82.6% of the cohort was treated with antibiotics. Conclusions: Significant variation was found between the different PICUs regarding RSV bronchiolitis diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support, which may not be accounted for by the differences in baseline and clinical characteristics of the infants.

This diversity and the documented routine use of medications with weak evidence of efficacy calls for national guidelines for bronchiolitis management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Electr...",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.03.031,,Netherlands,,"BACKGROUND: The optimum priming fluid for the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit is still debated. We compared a new hyperoncotic priming solution containing dextran 40, which has an electrolyte composition that mimics extracellular fluid, with a standard crystalloid-based prime. METHODS: Eighty cardiac surgery patients were included in this double-blind, randomized, single-center study. Patients were randomized to either a dextran-based prime or a crystalloid prime containing Ringer's acetate and mannitol. The primary end point was colloid oncotic pressure in serum during CPB. Secondary end points included fluid balance, bleeding and transfusion requirements, pulmonary function, hemolysis, systemic inflammation, and markers of renal, hepatic, myocardial, and brain injury. Blood samples were collected before, during, and after CPB. RESULTS: Colloid oncotic pressure was higher in the dextran group than in the crystalloid prime group during CPB (18.8 ± 2.9 versus 16.4 ± 2.9 mm Hg; P < .001) and 10 minutes after CPB (19.2 ± 2.7 versus 16.8 ± 2.9 mm Hg; P < .001). Patients in the dextran group required less intravenous fluid during CPB (1090 ± 499 versus 1437 ± 543 mL; P = .004) and net fluid balance was less positive 12 hours after surgery (1431 ± 741 versus 1901 ± 922 mL; P = .014). Plasma-free hemoglobin was significantly lower in the dextran group 2 hours after CPB (0.18 ± 0.11 versus 0.41 ± 0.33; P = .001). There were no significant differences in bleeding, transfusion requirements, organ function, systemic inflammation, or brain and myocardial injury markers between groups at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a hyperoncotic dextran-based priming solution preserves intraoperative colloid oncotic pressure compared with crystalloid prime. Larger studies with clinically valid end points are necessary to evaluate hyperoncotic prime solutions further.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

It has been suggested that trials stopped pre-maturely overestimate the treatment effect. With the outlined observational study, we aim to simulate the results of stopping trials before they reach their planned sample size to assess the effects on mortality estimates. Methods and statistics: Based on 3 international, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in critical care: Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock (6S) trial, the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial and the Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in the Intensive Care Unit (SUP-ICU) trial, we will estimate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome 90-day mortality after the inclusion of each individual patient in each RCT. This will be presented graphically with the primary outcome as a function of the number of included patients. Discussion: The outlined study will provide important knowledge about the effects of stopping critical care trials early. This may have important implications for patients, relatives, clinicians, researchers, guideline committee members and policy makers. Ethics and dissemination: We will use data from consenting patients enrolled in RCTs approved by the relevant ethical committees; this study requires no further permissions. We will report the results in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and submit the final approved manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Analyses of platelet count, Normotest®, antithrombin III, FDP and fibrinogen were used to divide the patients into three diagnostic groups: DIC (3 positive tests), suspected DIC (2 positive tests) and No DIC. Using these criteria 9, 8 and 5 patients were referred to these diagnostic groups, respectively. Factor XII and prekallikrein did not differ significantly between the three diagnostic groups. On the other hand the capacity of the patient plasma to inhibit kallikrein was significantly lower in the DIC group. The decrease of kallikrein inhibitory capacity was correlated to the decrease of antithrombin III and alpha2-antiplasmin. Out of these 22 patients in the study 8 patients died, 5 of these were in the DIC group. Non-surviving patients showed lower values of the protease inhibitors than survivors. It is concluded that in this type of patient and with the laboratory methods used contact phase factors do not seem to be affected in DIC. Analyses of the kallikrein inhibitory capacity, antithrombin and alpha2-antiplasmin on the other hand seem to be of interest to measure, though the decrease of these inhibitors could be due to consumption as well as to reduced protein synthesis. Further studies are needed to prove the prognostic value of assaying these protease inhibitors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Thrombopoietin (Tpo) has been shown to be a physiological regulator of thrombopoiesis. An inverse correlation between Tpo and the circulating platelet has been previously reported for several clinical conditions. Response pattern of Tpo to circulating platelets in TBI patients has not been studied yet. We hypothesised that in severe TBI patients thrombopoiesis response to TPO will be impaired Methodology: Plasma Tpo levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was measured 3 times i.e. Pre-platelet transfusion of platelets,24h and 48h post-transfusion in 100 severe (GSC≤8)TBI patients. Platelet transfusion response was evaluated and defined as a ≥20% increase in platelet count from baseline and patients were categorized as responders and non-responders to platelet transfusion. Results: Platelet count was low at admission (89.4±31.1∗10 per cumm). Less than 2 units of random donor platelets(RDP) was given to 14% patients,67% patients required2-4 units of RDP and 19% required >4 units of RDP. TPO levels decreased 24h post transfusion compared to pre transfusion (Mean±SD)(127.8±90.2 vs. 142.2±82.6 pg/ml; P 0.07), but elevated at 48h (209.1±74.8 pg/ml; p Pre vs. 48h 0.05). On Average the platelet count improved after transfusion at 24h to 112.7±74.6pg/ml (p Pre vs. 24h 0.003) and continued to rise at 48 h (123.7±82.1 pg/ml; p Pre vs. 48h 0.02). Platelet count and TPO levels were found to be independent (rho -0.12, p 0.38). 62% showed a ≥20% increase in platelet count from baseline (Responders), 38% were non-responders. As significant increase in 24 h post transfusion Tpo levels were seen in responders [median (IQR)] [173.6(0-202.4) pg/ml vs. 164.3(137.1-203.7) pg/ml; p 0.04] compared to pre transfusion levels. Tpo levels in Non-responders did not vary post platelet transfusion [156(0-198.11) pg/ml vs. 158.88(0-198.11) pg/ml; p 0.97]. 28% of Non-responders had low (<81.25 pg/ml) and 2.8% had high (>237.7 pg/ml) pre transfusion Tpo levels. At 24 h post transfusion 26.6% had low and zero had High Tpo levels. Conclusion: In the present study platelet transfusion response inversely correlates with Tpo levels, as 24h post platelet transfusion Tpo levels were transiently low but insignificant and elevated at 48h post transfusion. In non-responders, the post transfusion TPO levels were not sufficient to mitigate the low platelet counts. Hence, the possibility of transient bone marrow depression in severe TBI patients is suggested, which requires further analysis in a larger study cohort.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In 2009, WHO declared snake bite a neglected disease. Ophitoxaemia is an exotic term characterising the clinical spectrum of snake bite. Objectives: (1) To study clinical profile, complications and outcome in pediatric cases of snake bite with special reference to envenomation time. (2) To highlight the atypical presentations of snake bite. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was done in Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of our Hospital from June 2017 to June 2019. Results: Around 56.8% of 109 cases were non-poisonous snakebites. Out of 47 cases admitted to PICU, 68.08% developed cellulitis at the site of bite with staphyloccoccus aureus being the commonest organism isolated (56.25%). Anaerobes (bacteroides and clostridium) were also isolated in few cases. Edema at site of bite (hematotoxic) and ptosis (neurotoxic) were most common initial presentation. 36.17% of patients received ASV and first aid within 6 hours of snakebite. The morbidity and mortality was significantly less (p<0.05) as compared to those who hadn't received ASV. 12.76% of cases with normal CRT presented with features of coagulopathy. DIC (58.33% of hematotoxic bites) and respiratory paralysis (68.75% of neurotoxic bites) were the commonest complications. Renal replacement therapy was required in 6.38%, transfusion in 10.63% cases and case-fatality-rate was 12.7%. There were a few atypical presentations of snakebite mimicking Gullain-Barre syndrome, acute onset encephalitis with absent brainstem and pupillary reflexes, intracerebral hemorrhage and cortical blindness. Conclusion: Most snakebites are non-poisonous. One should not panic and over-treat since complications due to ASV are more. Early first aid and ASV administration has better outcome.

Aetiologies and clinical spectrum of MPHD in the developing countries are varied and quite different from that in the West. Tumours of the hypothalamo-pituitary (HP) region are the dominant cause of MPHD in the tertiary care referral centres, not only in the Western World, but also in India. There is real paucity of information regarding clinical profile and aetiology of MPHD from rural India. Methods: We analysed the presenting manifestations, hormonal parameters and imaging abnormalities in all patients of MPHD (n=53), evaluated in the Department of Medicine, Midnapore Medical College & Hospital between January 2016 to December 2018. Findings: Hypogonadism was the most common (54.7%) clinical manifestation of hypopituitarism in this study. Repeated hospitalization with spontaneous hypoglycaemia, recurrent hyponatremia and refractory anaemia were also common in this cohort. Vasculotoxic snake (viper) bite (VSB) was the commonest aetiology (30.2%) of MPHD overall, while Sheehan’s syndrome (SS) dominated in females. Patients of VSB were exclusively male, with the youngest one being 13-year old. Majority of these patients (87.5%) underwent several sessions of haemodialysis following the bite. 61.5% of SS delivered at home, and almost 92% had had severe post-partum haemorrhage requiring transfusion support. All patients of VSB had hypogonadism and hypoadrenalism, while all but one case of SS had cortisol deficiency. Agalactia was universal in SS. Empty sella on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the dominant abnormality (52.8%) encountered, while 3 patients had normal MRI findings. Implications: Hypopituitarism is often unrecognized; hence remains untreated, as primary care physicians are unaware of the varying clinical manifestations of MPHD. They need to be sensitised to have a high index of suspicion in appropriate clinical settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We aimed to assess prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe liver trauma undergoing perihepatic packing. METHODS: Prospectively collected records of 293 consecutive polytrauma patients with liver injury admitted at a level I trauma centre between 1996 and 2008 were reviewed. 39 patients with grade IV-V AAST liver injury and treated with peri-hepatic packing were identified and included for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 41 years. 34 patients were haemodynamically unstable at initial presentation. Ten of 39 patients were treated with angiographic embolization in addition to perihepatic packing. The overall mortality rate was 51.3%. Liver-related death occurred in 23.1%. Overall and liver-related morbidity rates were 90% and 28%, respectively. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), respiratory rate, packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion, pH and Base Excess (BE), Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS), need for angiographic embolization as well as early OR and ICU admission were associated with significant decrease of early mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Revised Trauma Score, haemodynamic instability, blood pH and BE are important prognostic factors influencing morbidity and mortality in polytrauma patients with grade IV/V liver injury. Furthermore, fast and effective surgical damage control procedure with perihepatic packing, followed by early ICU admission is associated with lower complication rate and shorter ICU stays in this patient population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Design: This was a prospective, single-blinded cohort study conducted for 1 year from July 2018 to June 2019. Setting: The study setting was the Department of Transfusion Medicine, along with Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiac Surgery and Cardiac biochemistry departments in a tertiary care cardiac centre. Participants: A total of 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the study period were divided into three groups (50 in each): Leukofiltered (LR), Buffy coat depleted (BCD) and Non-leukoreduced (NLR). Intervention: The intervention was intra- and postoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) having different amounts of leukocytes. Measurements and main results: Patient details about length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, blood usage, inotropic drug duration, mechanical ventilation, urine output and infection were recorded from the patient data sheet, whereas patients were followed up for 30 days post-operation, and any mortality was noted. Haematological parameters and biochemical parameters for renal function test were analysed on pre- and post-surgical days 1, 3, 5 and 7, whereas on postoperative days 1 and 7, cytokine-like FAS ligands, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interferon-γ (INF-γ) were tested. Patients in all three groups received an average of four, two and two units of packed red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma, respectively. There was a statistically significant (P <.05) rise in total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in all three groups from day 0 to day 3, but it reduced to preoperative level on day 5. There was shorter ICU and hospital stay in the LR group of patients (46 ± 19.9 hours and 7.5 ± 2.4 days) compared to NLR (52.1 ± 24.2 hours and 7.9 ± 4.1 days) and BCD (53.3 ± 26.7 hours and 8.8 ± 3.1 days) group of patients, but it was statistically non-significant. The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly lesser in LR group patients (10.2 ± 6.2 hours) as compared to NLR group (14.7 ± 12.7 hours). On risk ratio calculation of developing postoperative kidney injury, the NLR group had 1.3 and 2.6 times more risk compared to the BCD and LR groups, respectively. On postoperative days 1 and 7, FAS-L levels significantly increased in all three group of patients, whereas IL-10 increased in the NLR and BCD groups and decreased in the LR group non-significantly. The INF-γ levels decreased on day 1 in the NLR and BCD groups but increased in the LR group, but it was inversed on day 7. Conclusion: Depletion of leukocytes decreased Transfusion Related Immunomodulation (TRIM) effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but this also depends on the degree of leukoreduction. As found in our study, leukofiltration is more effective compared to buffy-coat depletion only.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Shodai""=>[""術後患者として除外してよろしいでしょうか？""], ""Takahiro""=>[""術後患者でした。吉廣先生の判断に賛成です。""]}",,"",,

RDW is an index of the variation in red cell volume. Some studies have shown an association of elevated RDW with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and mortality in general population. Data for RDW as predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) is sparse. The goal of the study was to correlate absolute RDW and change in RDW in first 24 hours of ICU admission as predictors of mortality and length of stay (LOS) for ICU patients. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted to ICU in January 2012. Patients were divided into 2 groups and analyzed based on RDW upon admission. Normal value in our laboratory for RDW is 10-14.5. A cutoff of 0.4 was randomly chosen to calculate delta changes in RDW. Demographics and laboratory characteristics were obtained. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were ICU and hospital LOS. Exclusion criteria were: white cell count >150,000/ml, death within 24 hours of ICU admission, blood transfusion requirement in prior 2 weeks, hematologic disease - leukemia, hemoglobinopathies, bone marrow metastasis. Results: 151 patients were analyzed, mean age 55.84 with 53.64% female. The average Apache IV was 68.35. Patients were separated based on absolute RDW and based on 24 hours delta-RDW≥0.4 and delta-RDW<0.4. Patients with higher than normal RDW had statistically significant difference in Apache IV, ICU and hospital LOS as compared to patients with normal RDW. There was a non significant trend for mortality in patients with higher RDW (Table). There was no difference for any outcome when patient were compared based on delta-RDW changes (Table). Conclusions: Our data suggest that admission RDW could be a sensitive tool to predict ICU and hospital LOS in medical ICU patients. There were no differences in outcomes when delta-RDW was analyzed. This data needs to be validated with a larger cohort in order to make conclusive recommendations. (Table Presented).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Lactate is produced via anaerobic glucose metabolism and can be used as a definitive metabolite. In theory, ScvO2 reflects whole body oxygen metabolism while lactate level reflects the condition of peripheral oxygen debt. Objectives: The objective of this study was to propose a graphical assessment of oxygen metabolism using ScvO2 and lactate level, and to show the potential availability of this method using two cases with impaired oxygen metabolism. Methods: The graph we propose is divided into four subset areas by lactate concentration (horizontal; cutoff 2 mmol/l); and ScvO2 (vertical; cutoff 70%). Left upper (subset I) is “normal” area. Left lower (subset II) is “unbalanced oxygen supply/demand”. Right upper (subset III) is “peripheral hypoperfusion, and/or dysoxia”. Right lower (subset IV) is overlapped with subset II and III. The patient data were drawn into this graph during ICU stay. Results: A 34-year-old female with connective tissue disease was suffering from severe hypotension of unknown cause. She had an extremely high lactate level (19.7 mmol/l) with borderline ScvO2 (68%) and was classified as subset IV at ICU admission. With cathecholamine infusion, we initiated infused milrinone from 18h later and she moved into subset I 50h later. She finally recovered and was discharged from the ICU 4 days later. A 96-year-old female undergone hip surgery was admitted to the ICU. Nurses could not recognize considerable postoperative bleeding because internal blood had not been drained into a drainage bag. ScvO2 decreased from 60% to 37%, lactate increased from 3.5 to 6 mmol/l, and hemoglobin decreased from 8.4 to 5.9 g/dl until 2h after ICU admission. After massive transfusion, she finally recovered and discharged from the ICU. The graph provided better indicator for these conditions than other monitors and parameters (BP, CI, CVP, etc). Discussion: Attention must be paid not only to the area point itself, but also to the direction of the arrow. Serial assessment over time on the graph could elicit an intuitive evaluation of the on-going therapy and create a consensus assessment of oxygen metabolism among doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. This method can be used for an educational tool for residents and medical students. Conclusion: A two-dimensional, four-subset classification graph using lactate and ScvO2 can be a simple and useful tool to assess the complicated impaired oxygen metabolism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Materials and methods: The total of 208 patients admitted with isolated head injury were included in this study, during the period of two years (June2008 to May 2010). Of these, 108 patients had severe head injury and 100 patients had moderate head injury. Coagulation parameters PT, PTT, TT, fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Platelet count and Arterial blood gas parameters were measured. Results and conclusion: Co-agulopathy occurs frequently in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The result of this study shows that the admission day is most important in diagnosis and management of co-agulopathy. Another significant finding of this study was a significant increase in TT on day 3 in patients. There is activation of fibrinolytic system in majority of patients following head trauma as a majority of patients presented with elevated d-dimer level, irrespective of whether they developed co-agulopathy or not. On day 3 following trauma, acidosis was found to be associated with co-agulopathy. Independent risk factors for mortality following severe head injury include decreased platelet counts, FFP transfusion, and acidosis. Presence of co-agulopathy was found to affect the outcome following moderate head injury; Co-agulopathy, GCS ≤8, DIC score ≥5, presence of acidosis at admission and transfusion requirement of >5 units of FFP were found to have decreased median survival. In this study, co-agulopathy was associated with 51% mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Canadian Consensus Conference and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) working group criteria are used for the diagnosis. Case report: A 59 year old male was hospitalized for chronic diarrhea. He was using warfarin for prosthetic mitral valve. Abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of ascites and diagnostic paracentesis was performed. Iatrogenic intra-abdominal bleeding developed after the paracentesis and patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. His physical examination was unremarkable on admission without any sign of respiratory failure. Laboratory studies were as follows: Hb: 6.5 gr/dL, Hct: 19.1, PTZ(INR):2,5. A total of 12 units of erythrocyte suspension and fresh frozen plasma (6 units each) were transfused within 48 h of admission. One hour after the institution of last transfusion dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension developed. Arterial blood gases revealed hypoxia (pO2:65) and hypercarbia (pCO2:54). Transfusion was stopped immediately and the patient was intubated. Bilateral fine crackles were audible on lung auscultation. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations consistent with acute pulmonary edema. After exclusion of other possible causes (hypervolemia, cardiac and infectious causes etc) TRALI was diagnosed. Clinic, laboratory and radiologic findings resolved rapidly with conservative management. Discussion: Although TRALI is not so rare, it is usually misdiagnosed due to unawareness of the clinicians. In patients with acute lung injury, after all other causes are excluded TRALI should also be kept in mind if transfusion was done within the last 6 h.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The course and outcome of infections is a dynamic interplay between the host and the pathogen. Central to this interplay is the struggle for iron, a micronutrient essential to both the mammalian host and virtually all microbes.(1,2) OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study is to test whether markers of iron metabolism predict patient outcome in a cohort of sepsis patients. METHODS. Patients admitted with sepsis to the ICU were consecutively enrolled from January 2018 to March 2019. Sepsis was defined as fulfilment of Sepsis-3 criteria, patients were enrolled within 24 hours after admission or diagnosis of sepsis respectively. Patients with haemato-oncologic disorders and patients with prior transfusions were excluded from analysis. Serum ferritin, transferrin and iron, as well as interleukin-6, procalcitonin, c-reactive protein and SOFA scores were obtained at the day of study inclusion. Patient outcome was defined as ICU mortality or discharge. Predictor variables were tested for a significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors and imputed into a multiple logistic regression model. Predictors were tested for correlation with markers of inflammation. Statistical analyses were performed in R, results are presented as mean ±standard deviation. A p-value of >0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS. Of 31 included patients, 4 were excluded due to prior transfusion of blood products. Of the remaining 27 patients, four were excluded due to presence of an active haematologic disorder and one due to missing iron parameters. 27% of patients were female, mean age was 65 ±14 years with a mean SOFA score of 12 ±3. 64% of patients survived. Iron levels of survivors vs. non survivors differed significantly (4.87 ±2.47 vs. 7 ±5mmol/L; p = 0.01), as did levels of ferritin (median 700 vs. 302μg/L; p < 0.0001) and transferrin (121.64 ±46.67 vs. 87.75 ±58.86 mg/dL; p < 0.0001) between surviving and deceased patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis of these parameters against ICU mortality did select transferrin as best predictor with an AUC of 0.66. Correlation analysis of transferrin and markers of inflammation did not reveal significant associations. CONCLUSION. Parameters of iron metabolism differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors of sepsis in our cohort. Transferrin levels are inversely correlated with ICU mortality, but no statistical significant correlation could be shown with parameters of inflammation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, the differential diagnosis of neonatal thrombocytopenia is wide and includes potentially life-threatening disorders, such as bacterial sepsis, viral infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Distinguishing these causes of thrombocytopenia from entities such as genetic thrombocytopenia and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is critical for the accurate quantitation of significant adverse events, such as intracranial bleeding, and for the selection of treatments, such as platelet transfusion. In this review, we focus on common differential diagnoses of neonatal thrombocytopenia and highlight how the landscape of diagnosis and management is changing with recent advances in genomic technology and the completion of pivotal clinical trials of platelet transfusion practice. Increasing evidence highlights the need for judicious and restrictive use of platelet transfusions in neonates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Karger AG,,"Background: Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is often caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli, but other pathogens like Cl. perfringens or S. pneumoniae also can cause severe hemolysis. In the last-mentioned cases alterations of red blood cell (RBC) antigens may be observed. Case report: A 9 months old boy was admitted to the hospital because of cough and fever. In the chest X-ray the right hemithorax was completely shadowed by infiltrates and atelectasis. Therapy was started with cefuroxime and clindamycin was added later. At day 6 the patient showed a drop of the hemoglobin value to 3.0 g/dL (from 8.5 g/dL at day 4). Hemolysis was diagnosed by haptoglobin < 8 mg/dL and LDH 3550 U/L. Now the patient was admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation and peritoneal dialysis. Immediate transfusion of 1 RBC concentrate increased the Hb to 6.0 g/dL. At day 45 he left the hospital in a good general condition. Methods: At the time of admission to the ICU the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was performed by the gelcard method. T antigen activation on the RBCs was tested using Arachis hypogea lectin. Swabs from throat and nose as well as tracheal aspirate were cultured. PCR for detection of influenca A and B in a throat swab was done. Feces was tested for Shigatoxin by an ELISA. a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay for detection of soluble pneumococcal antigen in the urine was performed. Results: The monospecific DAT was positive with anti-C3d. T antigen was detected on the RBCs. Pneumococcal antigen was found in the urine at the same time. No pathogenic bacteria could be cultured from the upper and lower respiratory tract. The tests for influenca RNA and for Shigatoxin were negative. Conclusions: In the reported case T antigen activation on the RBCs suggested infection by a neuraminidase producing pathogen. Detection of pneumoccal antigen in the urine led to the correct diagnosis only a few hours after the onset of hemolysis. In contrast to culture techniques that provide results at the earliest after one day of incubation and that can be negative because of antibiotic treatment before specimen collection, immunological proof of pneumococcal antigen can resolve rapidly the reason for T antigen activation in some cases of HUS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODOLOGY: This is an observational study conducted at Vanivilas hospital between January 2012 to December 2013 for 24 months. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 104 women were studied with respect to period of gestation, parity, clinical features at presentation and management in the institution. An analysis of maternal morbidity and mortality was done with respect to surgical interventions, ICU admissions, need for blood transfusions and maternal deaths. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: In this study, there were 75 (72.2 %) cases of incomplete abortion, 10 (9.6 %) cases of missed abortion, 2 (1.9 %) cases of ruptured ectopic and 2 (1.9 %) cases of rupture uterus. Seventy-eight (75 %) cases received blood transfusion, 7 (6.7 %) were admitted to ICU, and 2 (1.9 %) developed acute kidney injury. There were 2 (1.9 %) maternal deaths in the study group. CONCLUSION: This study shows urgent need for legislation and restriction of drugs used for medical termination of pregnancy. Drugs should be made available via health care facilities under supervision to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity due to indiscriminate use of these pills.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

A significant portion of cost is due to the utilization of blood products in the OR. From 2/28/12 to 3/01/13, 64 liver transplants were performed at our institution. OR blood utilization data was recorded along with cost and length of stay (LOS). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine associations between MELD, blood product cost and length of stay. The mean MELD score was 33.2. The mean cost of overall blood products in the OR was $12938 (range $827-$35,146) and for total LOS was $21,982 (range $1,873-$67,624). MELD score is correlated to intraoperative blood product cost, LOS and ICU LOS but not intraoperative RBC utilization. Intraoperative blood product cost is correlated strongly to LOS and ICU LOS. A strong correlation was noted between both pre-operative hemoglobin and platelet count and intraoperative blood product cost. Factor VII utilization was at the discretion of the surgeon and anesthesiologist. Its use was not correlated with MELD. The minimization of blood product utilization is a potential area for improvement in outcomes and reduction of cost. Recognition of the pre-operative and intraoperative factors correlated with blood product administration and cost can lead to improved performance.

This was borne out by the forearm sign, the mandibular reflex, 'flexor pyramidal tract lesion signs', by tonic neck reflexes and by Hoffmann's sign. The development of the phenomenon of arm extension (abdominal Moro's phenomenon) as well as the sucking reflex were unaffected.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence, predictors, management, and clinical impact of AWS in patients hospitalized with AH. METHODS: A multinational, retrospective cohort study enrolling patients hospitalized with AH at 5 medical centres in Spain and in the USA was performed between January 1st, 2016 to January 31st, 2021. Data were retrospectively retrieved from electronic health records. Diagnosis of AWS was based on clinical criteria and use of sedatives to control AWS symptoms. The primary outcome was mortality. Multivariable models controlling for demographic variables and disease severity were performed to determine predictors of AWS (adjusted odds ratio [OR]) and the impact of AWS condition and management on clinical outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]). FINDINGS: In total, 432 patients were included. The median MELD score at admission was 21.9 (18.3-27.3). The overall prevalence of AWS was 32%. Lower platelet levels (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-2.48) and previous history of AWS (OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.31-3.33) were associated with a higher rate of incident AWS, whereas the use of prophylaxis decreased the risk (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93). The use of intravenous benzodiazepines (HR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.02-4.64) and phenobarbital (HR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.07-8.37) for AWS treatment were independently associated with a higher mortality. The development of AWS increased the rate of infections (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.44-3.49), the need for mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.38-4.49), and ICU admission (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.19-3.23). Finally, AWS was associated with higher 28-day (HR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.40-3.82), 90-day (HR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.69), and 180-day mortality (HR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.24). INTERPRETATION: AWS commonly occurs in patients hospitalized with AH and complicates the hospitalization course. Routine prophylaxis is associated with a lower prevalence of AWS. Prospective studies should determine diagnostic criteria and prophylaxis regimens for AWS management in patients with AH. FUNDING: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

2455 Teller Road, CA 91320",,"Pain in the newborn is complex, involving a variety of receptors and mechanisms within the developing nervous system. When pain is generated, a series of sequential neurobiologic changes occur within the central nervous system. If pain is prolonged or repetitive, the developing nervous system could be permanently modified, with altered processing at spinal and supraspinal levels. In addition, pain is associated with a number of adverse physiologic responses that include alterations in circulatory (tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction), metabolic (increased catabolism), immunologic (impaired immune response), and hemostatic (platelet activation) systems. This ""stress response"" associated with cardiac surgery in neonates could be profound and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Neonates undergoing cardiac operations are exposed to extensive tissue damage related to surgery and additional painful stimulation related to endotracheal and thoracostomy tubes that may remain in place for variable periods of time following surgery. In addition, postoperatively neonates endure repeated procedural pain from suctioning of endotracheal tubes, placement of vascular catheters, and manipulation of wounds (eg, sternal closure) and dressings. The treatment and/or prevention of pain are widely considered necessary for humanitarian and physiologic reasons. Improved clinical and developmental outcomes underscore the importance of providing adequate analgesia for newborns who undergo major surgery, mechanical ventilation, and related procedures in the intensive care unit.

Methods From June 2007 through December 2009, 104 consecutive patients (mean age 61.8 ± 10.2 years) with multivessel coronary artery disease underwent elective simultaneous coronary revascularization at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 104 patients who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting through median sternotomy during the same period. We compared these groups' in-hospital clinical outcomes and freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at a mean follow-up of 18 ± 7.9 months. Results The hybrid procedure required longer operative time and incurred higher in-hospital costs, but had shorter median intubation time (11.6 ± 6.3 vs 13.8 ± 6.8 hours, p = 0.02), intensive care unit length of stay (34.5 ± 35.6 vs 55.3 ± 46.4 hours, p < 0.001), and postoperative in-hospital length of stay (8.2 ± 2.6 vs 9.5 ± 4.5 days, p = 0.01). The hybrid group had significantly less chest tube drainage (789 ± 389 vs 834 ± 285 mL, p = 0.005) and need for blood transfusion (28.8% vs 51.9%, p > 0.001). At a mean follow-up of 18 months, the freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events is in favor of the hybrid group (99.0% vs 90.4%; p = 0.03). Conclusions Compared with conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, simultaneous hybrid coronary revascularization shortens recovery time and has superior outcomes at a mean follow-up of 18 months.

The ""virtual 3DUS placentoscopy"" can guide selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) to treat twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: Four different concentrations of our experimental heparin anticoagulant with iloprost additive (HEP-ILOP 50 nM, 150 nM, 1000 nM, and 10 μM, respectively) were tested for significant differences and bias performance specifications against EDTA for 29 hematology analytes, and the highest concentration (HEP-ILOP 10 μM) against lithium heparin for 14 chemistry and immunochemistry analytes. Samples were drawn from 79 consenting subjects from the Oncology Department (n = 38) and the Intensive and Intermediary Care Unit (n = 41). RESULTS: For hematology analytes, the HEP-ILOP formulation generally provided stable measurement within optimal requirements within 5 h after sampling (mean 104 ± 56 min), with very little difference between the four HEP-ILOP concentrations. Because of differences in platelet and red blood cell swelling between EDTA and HEP-ILOP, all size-dependent analytes required proportional factorization to produce similar results. Platelet count by impedance similarly required factorization, whereas the fluorescent method provided results identical with EDTA. Chemistry and immunochemistry analytes were within optimal requirements except for potassium, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose, indicating a cytoprotective effect of iloprost reducing cell metabolism and rupture, thereby producing results closer to in vivo conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel dry-sprayed anticoagulant formulation, HEP-ILOP, is a promising candidate for a polyvalent blood collection tube, enabling the analysis of hematology, chemistry, and immunochemistry analytes in the same tube.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, it is associated with prolonged recovery and potential complications, in part due to the invasiveness of the procedure. Less invasive CABG techniques attempt to improve the quality and quantity of life in the same way as surgical revascularization but with fewer complications. Minimally invasive coronary surgery (MICS) through a small thoracotomy allows for complete revascularization with good results in graft patency. Perioperative mortality is low, and there is decreased need for blood transfusion, lower surgical site infection rates, and an earlier return to full physical function. Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) attempts to combine the advantages of coronary artery bypass grafting with those of percutaneous coronary intervention. Several studies have shown that HCR provides better short-term outcomes with regard to decreased ventilation and ICU time, reduced need for blood transfusion, and shortened hospital stay. However, the rates for major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality are comparable to conventional CABG, except for patients with a high SYNTAX score who displayed increased mortality rates. There is also strong evidence of a higher need for repeat revascularization with HCR compared to CABG. Overall, MICS and HCR appear to be viable alternatives to conventional CABG, offering a less invasive approach to coronary revascularization, which may be especially beneficial to high-risk patients. This article discusses approaches that deliver the advantages of minimally invasive surgical revascularization that can be adapted by surgeons with minimal investment with regards to training and infrastructure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The study population was divided into two groups based on peak lactate levels. Group N with peak lactate level less than 2 mmol/L and Group H peak lactate level more than 2 mmol/L. The various parameter studied were patient's comorbidities; intraoperative events (vasopressor requirement, blood transfusion, and duration of surgery); postoperative parameters including the need for re- exploration and duration of stay in hospital and intensive care unit. RESULTS: The study demonstrates that intraoperative rise of lactate was not influenced by comorbidities. None of the intraoperative parameters studied influenced the lactate levels. Baseline lactate level was found to correlate with peak lactate level intraoperatively. But it was observed that there was normalization of lactate level within 24 hours postoperatively in both the groups. There was no difference in outcome parameters in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative hyperlactatemia is not a significant prognostic factor for outcome in oncoplastic reconstructive surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Immature platelet fraction (IPF) and platelet count at birth were determined simultaneously soon after phlebotomy with an automated hematology analyzer. Megakaryocytes and their precursors positive for CD41 in peripheral blood were examined at birth by flow cytometry. The thrombocytopenic group showed significantly higher IPF percentage and lower percentage of CD41+ mononuclear cells (MNCs) than did the non-thrombocytopenic group (P < 0.01).

We evaluated the risk factors for adverse fetal outcomes in critically ill pregnant women admitted to the intensive care unit for nonobstetrical reasons. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all critically ill pregnant patients >18 yr; admitted to four (medical, surgical, trauma, and mixed medical-surgical) intensive care units at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN; during the period of January 1995 to December 2005. Only pregnant women admitted to the intensive care unit in the antepartum period for nonobstetrical indications were included. Main predictors for fetal outcomes included: maternal comorbidities, obstetrical history, intensive care unit interventions, and intensive care unit complications. Fetal outcomes were defined as spontaneous abortions, neonatal mortality, fetal deaths, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, and neonatal intensive care unit complications. RESULTS: A total of 153 adult women (>18 yr) with a diagnosis of pregnancy were admitted to the intensive care unit, of whom 93 pregnant women met the inclusion criteria. Median maternal age was 26 yr (interquartile range 22-33) and median gestational age was 25 wk (interquartile range 8-33). The median maternal Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation III score was 27 (interquartile range 17-38). There were 32 fetal losses; 18 were spontaneous abortions and 14 were fetal deaths. Ten neonates required neonatal intensive care unit admission, five for respiratory distress syndrome; and only one neonate died. The median neonatal intensive care unit length of stay was 34 days (interquartile range 15-87). After multivariable logistic regression analysis, the risk factors associated with fetal loss were: presence of maternal shock, odds ratio 6.85 (95% confidence interval 1.16-58, p = 0.04); maternal transfusion of blood products, odds ratio 7.24 (95% confidence interval 1.4-49, p = 0.02); and gestational age, odds ratio 1.2 for every gestational week below 37 wk (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.3, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nonobstetrical critical illness in pregnant women significantly affects fetal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal shock, maternal requirement of allogenic blood product transfusion and lower gestational age were associated with an increased risk of fetal loss.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods and procedures: Coagulopathy was defined as an activated partial thromboplastin time >40seconds and/or prothrombin time (PT) >1.2 and/or platelet count <120*10 9l-1. Cranial CT scans were assigned to the six-point Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) CT-classification. Main outcomes and results: Coagulopathy occurred in 44 of patients in the first 24-hours post-trauma. Patients with acute, sustained coagulopathy showed a prolonged PT (1.64±0.89) when compared to patients without (1.03±0.07), acute temporary (1.27±0.22) or delayed coagulopathy (1.08±0.06; p<0.05). Patients with acute temporary or delayed coagulopathy had the worst TCDB CT classification scores, while mortality rates were the highest in patients with sustained or delayed coagulopathy. Conclusions: Not only the mere presence of coagulopathy, but also the course of haemostatic alterations following neurotrauma may hold predictive value for patient outcome, irrespective of the severity level of cerebral injury. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

It also included all cases presenting with overt DIC (OD) concomitantly (n = 30). The high-risk group (pre-DIC) was subdivided, according to their D-dimer assay, into negative (n = 14) and positive (n = 36) D-dimer groups. All three groups were evaluated, on admission, for their prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma fibrinogen level (Fi), fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), platelet count, and presence/absence of schistocytes in peripheral blood. The combination of D-dimer and FDP assay showed the best correlation for early pre-DIC diagnosis (r = 0.9048). FDP assay was the best parameter for follow-up of progress of DIC condition in the PICU. The lowest mortality was among negative D-dimer, followed by positive D-dimer and OD groups (28.6 per cent, 77.8 per cent, and 93.3 per cent, respectively). Among the positive D-dimer group the lowest mortality was encountered in the subgroup treated with plasma, heparin and tranexamic add (33 per cent) while those treated with non-specific therapy, plasma only, or plasma and heparin showed higher mortality (100 per cent, 80 per cent, and 100 per cent, respectively). The deceased subgroup, among positive D-dimer cases showed a significantly higher number of patients presenting with multiple organ failure on admission compared with the discharged group. In summary, early diagnosis and proper management of pre-DIC, before overt bleeding, in high-risk patients admitted to a PICU using combined D-dimer and FDP assays had a positive impact on their prognosis. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Less research has focused on the prognostic utility of red cell distribution width in an acutely hospitalized population. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data on 74,784 consecutive hospitalized adults with red cell distribution width measured on admission. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality; a secondary outcome was unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit. We calculated multivariable logistic models adjusted for age, gender, race, and comorbid conditions. Results: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.4). As red cell distribution width increased, so did mortality, from 0.2% (lowest red cell distribution width decile) to 4.4% (highest red cell distribution width decile). Unadjusted red cell distribution width significantly discriminated between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors (area under the curve 0.74). In multivariate analyses, for every 1% increment in red cell distribution width at the time of admission, the odds for in-hospital mortality increased by 24% (odds ratio 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27); findings were robust across comorbidity subgroups. The rate of unplanned intensive care unit transfer was 7.0% (95% CI, 6.8-7.2) and in unadjusted analyses increased more than 2-fold from 4.5% in the lowest to 11.6% in the highest red cell distribution width decile. This relationship was significantly confounded but remained significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1.04 per 1% red cell distribution width increment; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06). Conclusion: Red cell distribution width strongly and independently predicted in-hospital mortality in this large cohort of hospitalized patients. It also was associated with acute decompensation among patients on the general ward, but to a lesser degree. The mechanisms underlying these findings are unknown. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We used moderate induced hypothermia (30-33 degrees C) in 43 patients with severe head injury for prolonged periods (mean 8 days, range 2-19 days). RESULTS: Although nosocomial pneumonia (defined in this study as both new chest radiograph changes and culture of a respiratory pathogen from tracheal aspirate) was quite common (45%), death from sepsis was rare (5%). Other findings included hypokalaemia on induction of hypothermia and a decreasing total white cell and platelet count over 10 days. There were no major cardiac arrhythmias. There was a satisfactory neurological outcome in 20 out of 43 patients (47%).

In 2001, our state established an inclusive trauma system to improve mortality. In 2015, the trauma system had a consultation visit from the American College of Surgeons' Committee on Trauma, who made several recommendations. We hypothesized that continued maturation of this system would lead to more laparotomies prior to transfer to a higher level of care and better outcomes. METHODS Our trauma registry was queried to identify all patients transferred between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, who underwent laparotomy either before transfer or within 4 hours of arrival. The preconsultation (2010-2015) and postconsultation periods (2016-2020) were compared. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using χ2 and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. RESULTS We included 213 patients; 63 had laparotomy before transfer and 150 within 4 hours after transfer. Age, injury severity scores, systolic blood pressure, and mechanism of injury were not different between periods. Proportions of laparotomy before and after transfer and outcomes (mortality, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days) were also similar (p = 0.368 for laparotomy, p = 0.840, 0.124, 0.286, 0.822 for outcomes). Compared with the preconsultation period, the proportion of laparotomy performed before transfer for severe injuries (abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale score >3) significantly increased postconsultation (57.1% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.011). Incidence of damage-control laparotomies (43.9% vs. 23.6%; p = 0.020) and transfusion of plasma and platelets (33.6% vs. 13.2%; p < 0.001, 22.4% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.007, respectively) significantly increased. CONCLUSION Identification and surgical stabilization of critical patients at the non-Level I facilities prior to transfer, as well as blood product use and damage-control techniques, improved postconsultation, suggesting a shift in the approaches to surgical stabilization and resuscitation efforts in our trauma system.

Although technically complex, combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic esophageal resection is feasible. A case series of 20 patients who underwent minimally invasive total esophagectomy is presented. This study was a review of a prospective database. The purpose was to evaluate early results with laparoscopic total esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease. Between January 2003 and November 2005, 20 patients underwent minimally invasive esophageal surgery. All operations were performed by the same two surgeons. Age, gender, indications for surgery, pathologic stage, operative time, blood loss, transfusion requirements, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and mortality were recorded. Diet progression, dysphagia, and need for stricture management were also recorded. Of the 20 minimally invasive total esophagectomies performed, 18 (90%) were completed successfully. The average age of the patients was 53 years. Indications for surgery were malignancy (n = 13), carcinoma in situ in the setting of Barrett's esophagus (n = 2), and benign stricture (n = 3). The average operating time was 467 minutes (range 346-580 min). Median blood loss was 350 mL (range 150-500 mL). The median intensive care unit stay was 2 days, and the median hospital length of stay was 12 days. Pathology revealed that 7 per cent of patients had stage I disease, 27 per cent of patients had stage II disease, and 53 per cent of patients had stage III disease. There was a single mortality (5%), a cervical leak in two patients (10%), a gastric tip necrosis in one patient (5%), and tracheoesophageal fistula in one patient (5%). Major complications occurred in eight patients (40%) and minor complications in nine (50%). Thirteen (72%) patients were discharged on enteral tube feeds to supplement caloric intake. The application of minimally invasive techniques in the arena of esophageal surgery continues to evolve. This approach has the potential to improve mortality, hospital stay, and other outcomes when compared with open methods.

Therefore, routine prophylactic anticoagulation is widely recommended. Aside from unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, such as certoparin, have become increasingly used for prophylactic anticoagulation in critically ill patients. In this prospective study, we evaluated the potency of 3,000 IU certoparin administered once daily to reach antithrombotic antifactor Xa (aFXa) levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml in 62 critically ill patients. METHODS: AFXa levels were determined 4, 12 and 24 h after injection of certoparin. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin, fibrinogen, hemoglobin, platelet count, serum urea and creatinine concentrations were documented before and 12 and 24 h after injection of certoparin. RESULTS: Four hours after certoparin injection (n = 32), 28% of patients were within the antithrombotic aFXa range. After 12 and 24 h, 6% achieved antithrombotic aFXa levels. Because of a severe pulmonary embolism in one study patient, an interim analysis was performed, and the dosage of certoparin was increased to 3,000 IU twice daily. This regime attained recommended antithrombotic aFXa levels in 47%, 27%, 40% and 30% of patients at 4, 12, 16 and 24 h, respectively, after twice daily certoparin injection (n = 30). Antithrombin and fibrinogen concentrations slightly increased during the observation period. Low antithrombin concentrations before certoparin were independently correlated with underdosing of certoparin. Patients with aFXa levels <0.1 IU/ml 4 h after certoparin injection required vasopressors more often and had lower serum concentrations of creatinine and urea than patients with antithrombotic aFXa levels. CONCLUSION: Standard dosages of certoparin of 3,000 IU given once or twice daily are ineffective for attaining the recommended aFXa levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml in critically ill patients. Low antithrombin levels before certoparin administration were independently associated with low aFXa levels. Renal function and vasopressor therapy may further influence the effectiveness of certoparin in ensuring adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

ACS definition encompasses many types of lung damage, making early detection of the most severe forms challenging. We aimed to describe ACS-related lung ultrasound (LU) patterns and determine LU performance to assess ACS outcome. RESULTS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 56 ICU patients hospitalized for ACS in a tertiary university hospital (Paris, France). LU and bedside spirometry were performed at admission (D0) and after 48 h (D2). Complicated outcome was defined by the need for transfusion of ≥ 3 red blood cell units, mechanical ventilation, ICU length-of-stay > 5 days, or death. A severe loss of lung aeration was observed in all patients, predominantly in inferior lobes, and was associated with decreased vital capacity (22 [15-33]% of predicted). The LU Score was 24 [20-28] on D0 and 20 [15-24] on D2. Twenty-five percent of patients (14/56) had a complicated outcome. Neither oxygen supply, pain score, haemoglobin, LDH and bilirubin values at D0; nor their change at D2, differed regarding patient outcome. Conversely, LU re-aeration score and spirometry change at D2 improved significantly more in patients with a favourable outcome. A negative LU re-aeration score at D2 was an independent marker of severity of ACS in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is associated with severe loss of lung aeration, whose resolution is associated with favourable outcome. Serial bedside LU may accurately and early identify ACS patients at risk of complicated outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The piggyback technique has been used to preserve venous return, either via an end-to-side or standard piggyback (SPB), or via a side-to-side or modified piggyback (MPB) anastomosis, using a venous cuff from the recipient hepatic veins with partially clamping and preserves the recipient's inferior vena cava. However, whether these piggyback techniques improve the efficacy of OLT is unclear. To address the low quality of the available evidence, we performed a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of conventional, MPB, and SPB techniques. Methods: Literature was searched in Medline and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published until 2021 without any time restriction. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to compare the intra- and postoperative outcomes of conventional OLT, MPB, and SPB techniques. Results: Forty studies were included, comprising 10,238 patients. MPB and SPB had significantly shorter operation times and fewer transfusions of red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma than conventional techniques. However, there were no differences between MPB and SPB in operation time and blood product transfusion. There were also no differences in primary non-function, retransplantation, portal vein thrombosis, acute kidney injury, renal dysfunction, venous outflow complications, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, 90-day mortality rate, and graft survival between the three techniques. Conclusion: MBP and SBP techniques reduce the operation time and need for blood transfusion compared with conventional OLT, but postoperative outcomes are similar. This indicates that all techniques can be implemented based on the experience and policy of the transplant center.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We aimed to evaluate the association between GPR and outcomes after cardiac arrest (CA). METHODS: A total of 354 consecutive patients with CA were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into three groups according to tertiles of GPR (low, n = 119; middle, n = 117; and high, n = 118). To determine the relationship between GPR and prognosis, a logistic regression analysis was performed. The ability of GPR to predict the outcomes was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Two prediction models were established, and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were utilized for model comparison. RESULTS: Among the 354 patients (age 62 [52, 74], 254/354 male) who were finally included in the analysis, those in the high GPR group had poor outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that GPR was independently associated with the three outcomes, for ICU mortality (odds ratios (OR) = 1.738, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.221-2.474, P = 0.002), hospital mortality (OR = 1.676[1.164 - 2.413], P = 0.005), and unfavorable neurologic outcomes (OR = 1.623[1.121 - 2.351], P = 0.010). The area under the ROC curve was 0.611 (95% Cl: 0.558-0.662) for ICU mortality, 0.600 (95% CI: 0.547-0.651) for hospital mortality, and 0.602 (95% CI: 0.549-0.653) for unfavorable neurologic outcomes. Further, the LRT analysis showed that compared with the model without GPR, the GPR-combined model had a higher likelihood ratio χ (2) score and smaller AIC. CONCLUSION: GPR, as an inflammatory indicator, was independently associated with outcomes after CA. GPR is helpful in estimating the clinical outcomes of patients with CA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Hospitals with appropriateness rates below 90% underwent a 3-month intervention which included: adoption of standardized RBC guidelines, staff education, and prospective transfusion order screening by blood bank technologists. Proportions of RBC transfusions adjudicated as appropriate and the total number of RBC units transfused per month in the pre- and post-intervention period were examined.

Proportions of appropriateness and single-unit orders increased from 73.5% to 85% and 46.2% to 68.2%, respectively from pre- to post-intervention (P <.0001). Pre- and post-transfusion hemoglobin levels and the total number of RBCs transfused decreased from baseline (P <.05). The median pre-transfusion hemoglobin decreased from a baseline of 72.0 g/L to 69.0 g/L in the post-intervention period (P <.0001). RBC transfusions per acute inpatient days decreased significantly in intervention hospitals, but not in control hospitals (P <.001). The intervention had no impact on patient length of stay, need for intensive care support, or in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: This multifaceted intervention demonstrated a marked improvement in RBC transfusion appropriateness and reduced overall RBC utilization without impacts on patient safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

There is an increasing proportion of DDH from intensive care units. Secure DDH can improve health system, resource utilization, and costs. Methods: We evaluated the characteristics and clinical outcomes of 3118 patients admitted to the CICU between 2014 and 2019. The sample was divided into two groups: DDH group=373; discharge after ward (DAW) group=2745. The analysis was performed by SPSS version 22.0 software, significance level of p <0.05. Data normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For the comparison between continuous variables the Wilcoxon test was used and for the categorical variables the chi-square test was used. Results: Discharge directly to home increased from 49 (1.57% of all survivors) patients in 2014 to 82 (2.82%) patients in 2019. Regarding the baseline characteristics of DDH group, it was found mean age 66.23±13.93, male predominance 57.10%, main hospitalization diagnoses: arrhythmias 24.10%, stent implantation 24.90%, unstable angina 13.40%. Regarding on clinical outcomes: ICU length of stay (DDH=2.59±2.64; DAW: 3.30±3.99; P=0.000), severity by SAPS 3 points (DDH: 40.75±9.99; DAW: 43.42±12.64; P= 0.000), readmission rate (DDH: 6.20%; DAW: 9.30%; P=0.043), as well as the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (DDH: 2.90%; DAW: 18.90%; P=0.000), use of vassopressors (DDH: 13,90%; DAW: 32.80%; P=0.000) and blood transfusion (DDH: 1.90%; DAW: 4.10%; P=0.032) were statistically smaller in DDH group (Table1). Conclusions: Severity, readmission and lengh of stay were lower in patients receiving discharges directly to home. It seems like a safe way to discharge low-risk short stay patients. It seems to save resources and reduce costs, as well as the need for hospital beds. However, futher estudies are needed to actualy evaluate this safety.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized, blinded, prospective trial of patients undergoing elective, complex cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, patients were randomized to one of three groups: 1) high‐dose heparin (HH) receiving an initial heparin dose of 450 u/kg, 2) heparin concentration monitoring (HC) with Hepcon Hemostasis Management System (HMS; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) monitoring, or 3) a control group (C) receiving a standard heparin dose of 300 u/kg. Primary outcome measures were blood loss and transfusion requirements. RESULTS: There were 269 patients block randomized based on primary versus redo sternotomy to one of the three groups from August 2001 to August 2003. There was no difference in operative bleeding between the groups. Chest tube drainage did not differ between treatment groups at 8 hours (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile] for control group was 321 [211, 490] compared to 340 [210, 443] and 327 [250, 545], p = 0.998 and p = 0.540, for HH and HC treatment groups, respectively).

Methods: This study included 119 patients who were admitted to the ICU. The PDMP levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay three times a week, for a total of 372 samples. We calculated the maximum (max. PDMP value, max PDMP/platelet (PDMP/Plts. ratio (converted to the PDMP levels per 104 platelets. and nadir platelet count during the ICU stay. Baseline patient data and scores, including the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM.

Results: The max PDMP/Plts ratio was significantly different comparing the survivors (n= 98: median, 2.54. and non-survivors (n=21: median 17.59; p＜0.001). There was a weak but statistically significant negative correlation between the max PDMP level and nadir platelet count (r = － 0.332, p＜0.001). The max PDMP level and max PDMP/Plts ratio were higher in the DIC group (81.48 and 9.27, respectively. than in the non-DIC group (34.88 and 2.35, p=0.001 and p＜0.001, respectively). The max PDMP/Plts ratio was the only variable found to be independently associated with hospital mortality according to a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: PDMPs are involved in the development of DIC but are not related to hospital mortality.

METHODS: Between 2010 and 2012, a prospective study was conducted on 49 geriatric patients, who took antiplatelet agents, sustained FNF and underwent surgery within 72 h [early surgery (ES) group], and these were compared with a retrospective consecutive case series of patients with similar characteristics (45 cases) who had delayed surgery (DS group) after 72 h during an earlier 3-year period. Postoperative outcomes were followed for one year and compared. RESULTS: There were non-significant differences in perioperative blood loss, blood transfusion, intensive care unit requirement and postoperative mortality (P > 0.05 all). There were 2 patients (4%) in the DS group who died after surgery (P = 0.23). However, the ES group showed a significantly better postoperative outcome in terms of postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and functional outcome (P < 0.05 all). CONCLUSION: Early hip surgery in geriatric hip fracture patients with ongoing antiplatelet treatment was not associated with a significant increase of perioperative blood loss and postoperative mortality. Moreover, ES resulted in a better postoperative surgical outcome. In early hip surgery protocol, the antiplatelet agents are discontinued and the patient is operated on within 72 h after admission, which is safe and effective for the medically fit patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods Consecutive adult anemic patients (preoperative hemoglobin <13.0 g/dL in men and <12.0 g/dL in women) resident in Puglia region who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2011 and November 2013 were considered. Vital status was ascertained from the date of surgery to December 31, 2013. Odds ratio and hazard ratio (HR) were estimated. Propensity score methods were used to control for confounders. Results Of 939 anemic patients (234 female, aged 71 ± 9 years), 361 underwent operation with the off‐pump technique and 578 underwent operation with the on‐pump technique. Patients undergoing off‐pump coronary artery bypass had a shorter intensive care unit length of stay, lower blood transfusion rate, and postoperative reduction in creatinine clearance. During a median follow‐up of 18 months, 126 patients died: 46 in hospital (35 on‐pump) and 80 after discharge (33 on‐pump). In comparison with the off‐pump technique, the on‐pump technique had greater hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.57; P =.028) and 30‐day incidence of fatal events (HR, 2.67; P =.026). After a period without risk differences between groups (1‐6 months; HR, 0.79; P =.618), a lower mortality in those undergoing the on‐pump technique was detected (after 6 months HR, 0.35; P =.014). All results were confirmed in the 157 pairs of patients matched for propensity score, anemia grade, and surgery center. Conclusions In patients with low levels of preoperative hemoglobin, off‐pump coronary artery bypass was associated with lower early morbidity and mortality but a greater risk of mortality during follow‐up compared with on‐pump coronary artery bypass.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study aimed to establish a correlation between platelet count and outcomes of severe sepsis/septic shock in pediatric patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a pediatric tertiary care medical hospital. Pediatric patients from newborns to 14-year-olds with a diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to the PICU between April 2015 and February 2018 were enrolled. Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence of thrombocytopenia: thrombocytopenia group (TG) with a platelet count <150,000/μL during the first seven days after admission, and non-thrombocytopenia group (NTG) with a platelet count >150,000/μL. RESULTS: Overall, 206 children were enrolled, including 82 (39.8%) in the TG and 124 (60.2%) in the NTG. Thrombocytopenia was more common in patients with a negative bacterial blood culture (93.9%, P = 0.007). NTG was associated with a higher mortality rate (29%) than the TG (12.2%, P = 0.005). Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) at the onset of sepsis (time zero) was found to be more prevalent in NTG than in TG (P = 0.001), while the progression of MODS over the three days remained the same in both groups. CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia was more associated with non-bacterial sepsis/septic shock, and it may indicate a better outcome of sepsis in pediatric patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The use of anticoagulants is increasing in older patients, but there are little data on outcomes after traumatic brain injury while anticoagulated with direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that anticoagulated patients would have a greater mortality and complications than nonanticoagulated patients, and patients on direct oral anticoagulants would have more fatal outcomes after low-level falls because of lack of reversal agents. Methods: Patients 65 years or older admitted to level 1–3 trauma centers with 24-hour neurosurgical care were identified through the administrative database of 19 Trinity Health hospitals. Patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes consistent with low-level fall and traumatic brain injury from May 2013 through October 2015 were included. Preadmission warfarin or direct oral anticoagulant use was extracted from admission reconciliation of medications in the database. Results: A total of 700 patients met inclusion criteria with 177 on anticoagulants before admission. Anticoagulated patients had more cardiac (P <.001), pulmonary (P <.001), and clotting (P <.02) comorbidities. Warfarin patients had the greatest neurosurgical intervention rate at 18% compared with direct oral anticoagulants (2.8%, P <.02) or nonanticoagulation (11%, P <.02). No difference was identified in overall mortality and mortality after neurosurgical intervention between the nonanticoagulated, warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulant groups. Warfarin patients received more plasma (P <.001) and red cell transfusions (P =.035) with greater intensive care unit stays (P <.001) compared with direct oral anticoagulant or nonanticoagulated patients. With logistic regression, only advancing age (P <.05) and a lesser Glasgow Coma Scale score (P <.01) were associated with greater mortality. Conclusion: Older direct oral anticoagulant patients with traumatic brain injury after low-level fall did not have increased morbidity or mortality compared with those treated with warfarin or who were not treated with anticoagulants. Concerns over the use of direct oral anticoagulant agents in this population may be overstated and deserve more scrutiny.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The patient underwent high-risk cardiac re-operation with the use of the alternative anticoagulant, bivalirudin. Clinical features: A 62-yr-old patient who underwent stentless tissue aortic valve replacement with a Toronto-SPV valve in 1998, was admitted to hospital with symptoms of stroke. A heparin infusion was started and further investigation revealed positive blood cultures. The patient developed HIT which was confirmed by laboratory tests. Echocardiographic examination performed one month later showed vegetations on the aortic tissue valve and a small aortic root abscess. The patient still tested positively for the presence of HIT antibodies and was treated conservatively with antibiotics. A repeat echocardiographic examination showed progression of the aortic root abscess and it was decided to proceed with urgent redo aortic valve surgery. Anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was achieved with the use of a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), bivalirudin. Following an uneventful wean from CPB, hemostasis was achieved within 40 min. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged from hospital on the seventh postoperative day. Conclusion: Bivalirudin is a DTI, which can be used as an alternative anticoagulant for CPB in HIT positive patients. This case report showed a favourable outcome with bivalirudin for urgent complex redo cardiac surgery requiring CPB.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim of this study was to determine whether binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ enhanced crosstalk among the various components of the neurovascular unit, leading to synaptic recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The soluble PDGF-BB from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH was measured. The relationship between PDGF-BB treatment and astrocytic PDGFRβ signaling was further explored in vivo and in vitro in experimental SAH models. Compared with the levels in the control samples, the PDGF-BB protein levels in the CSF of patients with SAH were significantly increased. After the generation of experimental SAH, astrocyte activation markers were markedly induced by the binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ, accompanied by improved levels of synaptic recovery and cognitive function. Soluble PDGF-BB and astrocytic PDGFRβ signaling are essential for the neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus and the coculture system in vitro after SAH that otherwise leads to cognitive dysfunction and neuronal damage.—Zhou, X., Wu, Q., Lu, Y., Zhang, X., Lv, S., Shao, J., Zhou, Y., Chen, J., Hou, L., Huang, C., Zhang, X.

Free bilirubin (Bf) seems a more reliable predictor for bilirubin neurotoxicity. Bilirubin/albumin ratio (B/A) is considered a surrogate parameter for Bf and has been more useful than TSB. The aim of the study is to determine whether B/A ratio correlates with BIND in newborns with severe hyperbilirubinemia and if it can predict poor neurologic outcome at 3 months follow up. Results: This prospective study included one hundred seventeen outborn neonates ≥ 35 weeks admitted in a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit, between May and December 2012, with TSB ≥ 20 mg/dl or necessitating exchange transfusion. Total serum bilirubin and serum albumin were done on admission and bilirubin/albumin ratio was calculated. BIND score was calculated. At the age of 3 months, 112 neonates were followed up with a detailed neurological assessment. Babies who depicted any abnormal motor examination were subjected to brain stem auditory evoked response and MRI examination. Seven infants (6.2%) presented with kernicterus on follow up. BIND scores on admission, mean TSB, and bilirubin/albumin ratio was significantly higher in kernicteric infants compared with those having normal neurological outcome at 3 months of age (P 0.001). The lowest TSB level at which kernicterus occurred in our study was 31 mg/dl. Receiver operation characteristics analysis identified B/A ratio cut off value for predicting kernicterus of 9.6 with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.4%, whereas TSB cut off value of 30 mg/dl showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 83%.

Hypertensive emergency in pregnant patients can cause many serious complications to both the mother and the fetus and are often commonly associated with eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Rarely, hypertensive emergency can cause thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) that can mimic HELLP syndrome. Here we present a rare case of TMA caused by hypertensive emergency in a pregnant patient. A 35 year-old pregnant African-American female at 27 weeks gestation presented to labor and delivery with dyspnea for 2 days. Patient had medical history of gestational hypertension and little prenatal care. Patient was noted to have a blood pressure of 263/140 and was admitted for further management. IV labetalol was administered without improvement and the decision was made to perform emergent C-section due to fetal distress. Post-operatively, patient was unable to be extubated and was transferred to ICU. Chest x-ray showed severe diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema. Patient's labs were significant for hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 28.0%, platelet 64,000, creatinine 7.71 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 80 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 57 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 48 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 1175 IU/L, and haptoglobin < 10 mg/dL. Originally, patient was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome. However, due to minimal elevation of AST, an alternative diagnosis was sought. Peripheral blood smear was performed which revealed 2 schistocytes/hpf, which suggested TMA. Due to risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), patient was urgently transferred to a facility capable of plasmapheresis. After transfer, patient had improvement in condition with blood pressure control and work-up ruled out TTP and HUS. Patient was diagnosed with TMA secondary to hypertensive emergency and transferred back. On return, patient's blood pressure was managed by multiple anti-hypertensives. Patient was started on hemodialysis for acute renal failure. Patient stabilized and was discharged to continue outpatient dialysis after 12 days. Hypertensive emergency can affect many different organ systems. For example patients can present with retinal hemorrhages, pulmonary edema, and cerebrovascular hemorrhage. In pregnant patients, uncontrolled hypertension is even more dangerous as it may cause fetal distress or demise. It is also possible for hypertension to cause TMA, which is extremely difficult to differentiate from HELLP, HUS, or TTP in pregnant patients. However it is easy to manage as patients will often improve with blood pressure control without need for plasmapheresis or other costly treatments. Accurate diagnosis and early intervention may be able to prevent maternal or fetal mortality. (Figure Presented).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival on the hospital (T-CPA) usually suffered from lethal hemorrhage and required rapid supplement of red blood cells for resuscitation of circulation and oxygen transport, that is to say BTT. However, the prognosis of T-CPA patients is well known hopeless. The aim of this study is to evaluate the propriety of our strategy concerning BTT for T-CPA patients. SUBJETCS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the medical records of T-CPA patients for the past 10 years. We do BTT until 1998 (the first period) for T-CPA patients regardless of ROSC without any restriction. After then (the second period), we do BTT case by case but only after ROSC in principle. The rate of ROSC, admission to ICU, survive to discharge were compared between these two period, and were compared within the first period between the patients group who underwent BTT (BTT group) and the group who did not underwent BTT (non-BTT group). RESULTS: In 477 blunt T-CPA and 29 penetrating T-CPA patients, 34 and 59% achieved ROSC, 18 and 38% admitted to ICU, and 3 and 14% were survive to discharge. In penetrating T-CPA in the first period, 12 units of packed red cells (PRC) were used before ROSC for 1 non-survivors. In the second period, no PRC was used for non-survivor before ROSC. In blunt T-CPA in the first period, PRCs were used for 29 non-survivors before ROSC. In the second period no PRC was used for non-survivors before ROSC. Concerning the effect of BTT on the prognosis of T-CPA in all cases, the rate of ROSC and admission to ICU were statistically higher in the first period than in the second period (p = 0.0003 and 0.032). However, there was no statistical difference in the rate of survive-to-discharge between these periods. There was a same tendency in witnessed cases. In cases with electrical rhythm on the scene, only the rate of ROSC were higher in the first period (p = 0.007). Restricted in the first period, only the rate of ROSC was statistically higher in non-BTT group than BTT group in all cases, in witnessed cases, and in cases with electrical rhythm on the scene (p = 0.005, 0.008, and 0.003). However, there was no statistical difference in the rate of admission to ICU and survive-to-discharge between these groups.. CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective serial study showed a possibility that BTT before ROSC for T-CPA improves the success rate of ROSC but add no effect on the improvement of survival rate. BTT is thought to be futile for T-CPA before ROSC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Included"", ""Takahiro""=>""Included""}",,"",,

Aim: To study the effect of AKI on hospital-based outcomes in patients with variceal hemorrhage. Material and methods: We obtained data from the National Inpatient Sample for the years 2016–2018. Study inclusion criteria comprised adult variceal hemorrhage patients who also had AKI. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, hospital charge, shock, blood transfusion, and ICU admission. We also determined the independent predictors of mortality in variceal hemorrhage patients using multivariate regression analysis. We used 2 different methods: multivariate logistic regression and propensity matching to adjust for confounders. Results: The number of people included in this study was 124,430, of whom 32,315 (26%) had AKI. Mortality in variceal hemorrhage patients with AKI was 30.4% in comparison to 4.8% without AKI. The presence of AKI was associated with increased odds of mortality (AOR = 8.28, 95% CI: 7.45–9.20, p < 0.01), ICU admissions (AOR = 4.76, 95% CI: 4.42–5.13, p < 0.01), blood transfusion (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15–1.32, p < 0.01), and shock (AOR = 3.41, 95% CI 3.07–3.79, p < 0.01). The patients with AKI also had increased length of stay and hospital charges. Higher Charlson co-morbidity index, African American race, and being admitted to large sized hospital were independently associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: After analyzing the combined NIS dataset of 2016–2018, we concluded that patients admitted with variceal hemorrhage who has AKI are prone to adverse hospital outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The rates of early marginal ulcers have decreased from 3.48 to 2.37 per 1000 person/year from 2015 to 2021 in the United States. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with readmission due to MU within 30 days after RYGB and the postoperative 30-day outcomes of this cohort. Methods Patients who underwent RYGB and required readmission for Marginal Ulcer (MU) were identified using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database from 2015 to 2021. Those who had a reoperation, intervention, or readmission due to causes other than MU were excluded. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Among 302,612 patients undergoing RYGB, 631 (0.21%) required readmission due to MU. Among these cases, 89.5% (n=565) required an intervention: 79.5% (n=502) underwent an endoscopic procedure, 4.1% (n=26) required reoperation, and 5.9% (n=37) underwent both. Parameters independently associated with an increased risk for early readmission due to MU included being African American (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.61), current use of therapeutic anticoagulation (AOR, 1.81), or steroids/immunosuppressive drugs (AOR, 1.64), prolonged operative time (>120 min) (AOR, 1.20), and history of cardiac stenting (AOR, 2.85), deep vein thrombosis (AOR, 2.19), and renal insufficiency (AOR, 2.17) (Figure 1). Additionally, patients who had early MU reported significantly higher rates of postoperative complications such as cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications, blood transfusion requirement, unplanned ICU admission, venous thromboembolism, surgical site infection (SSI), and sepsis (p<0.05). Conclusion The incidence of early readmission for MU following RYGB was less than 1%. Most of these cases required an endoscopic intervention. Some patient-related factors and increased operative time contributed to an increased risk of early readmission due to MU.

However, research examining intraoperative factors such as fluid resuscitation, mechanical ventilation strategies, and blood administration on the postoperative development of ARDS is lacking. Methods: We assessed patients admitted to the ICU with postoperative hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for the development of ARDS in the first 7 postoperative days using established clinical and radiological criteria. Data on risk factors for ARDS were obtained from the electronic anesthetic and medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine the independent association between fluid resuscitation, TV per ideal body weight, and number of blood products transfused during surgery and the postoperative development of ARDS, adjusting for important clinical covariates. Results: Of the 89 patients with postoperative respiratory failure, 25 developed ARDS. Compared with those who received <10 mL/kg/h fluid resuscitation in the operating room, patients receiving >20 mL/kg/h fluid resuscitation had a 3.8 times higher adjusted odds of developing ARDS (P = 0.04), and those receiving 10 to 20 mL/kg/h had a 2.4 times higher adjusted odds of developing ARDS (P = 0.14). TV per ideal body weight and the number of blood units transfused were not associated with ARDS development in this study. Conclusions: This cohort study provides evidence to suggest a relationship between intraoperative fluid resuscitation and the development of ARDS. Larger prospective trials are required to confirm these findings. © 2010 International Anesthesia Research Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The purpose of the present study is to develop and validate prediction models for AKI recovery at hospital discharge in critically ill patients with ICU-acquired AKI stage 3 (AKI-3). METHODS: Models were developed and validated in a development cohort (n = 229) and a matched validation cohort (n = 244) from the multicenter EPaNIC database to create prediction models with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) machine-learning algorithm. We evaluated the discrimination and calibration of the models and compared their performance with plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) measured on first AKI-3 day (NGAL_AKI3) and reference model that only based on age. RESULTS: Complete recovery and complete or partial recovery occurred in 33.20% and 51.23% of the validation cohort patients respectively. The prediction model for complete recovery based on age, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), diagnostic group (cardiac/surgical/trauma/others), and sepsis on admission had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.53. The prediction model for complete or partial recovery based on age, need for RRT, platelet count, urea, and white blood cell count had an AUROC of 0.61. NGAL_AKI3 showed AUROCs of 0.55 and 0.53 respectively. In cardiac patients, the models had higher AUROCs of 0.60 and 0.71 than NGAL_AKI3's AUROCs of 0.52 and 0.54. The developed models demonstrated a better performance over the reference models (only based on age) for cardiac surgery patients, but not for patients with sepsis and for a general ICU population. CONCLUSION: Models to predict AKI recovery upon hospital discharge in critically ill patients with AKI-3 showed poor performance in the general ICU population, similar to the biomarker NGAL. In cardiac surgery patients, discrimination was acceptable, and better than NGAL. These findings demonstrate the difficulty of predicting non-reversible AKI early.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

RESULTS: A total of 115 patients (4 female and 111 male) with a mean age of 32.88±12.87 years were included in the study. The mean hospitalization period was 25.03±20.50 days, and the mean total body surface area burned (% TBSA) was 22.83±15.54%.

The remaining 37 patients were on no antiaggregant therapy (group 4). Total chest tube drainage during the first 24 h, the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, blood and blood products usage, and the early outcome (duration of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit stay and total hospital stay), were assessed. Total chest tube drainage was significantly higher in the patients with clopidogrel exposure and increased amount of transfusions with blood products were also observed in those patients. The patients with clopidogrel exposure required significantly more reoperation for bleeding. The duration of controlled ventilation and intensive care unit stay were also significantly longer in the patients with clopidogrel exposure.

The outcome of multiple pregnancies is mainly dependent on chorionicity. Most perinatal complications are 3 to 12 times more prevalent in monochorionic pregnancies. The increased mortality and morbidity in this setting are mainly related to vascular anastomoses on the chorionic plate, joining the two fetal circulations. Intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin leads to exsanguination of the survivor, with fatal outcome in 20 to 30% of cases and a similar rate of severe ischemic complications. The most severe and acute complication is the twin‐to‐twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The main clinical manifestations of TTTS are the polyuric polyhydramnios‐‐oliguric oligohydramnios sequence in the recipient and donor twin, respectively. TTTS is associated with a perinatal mortality rate of around 90%, and neurological sequelae are present in 20‐40% of survivors born at around 25 weeks. Serial amnioreduction was long the only fetal therapy for TTTS, improving the survival rate to around 50% for at least one twin delivered at around 28 weeks, and reducing the risk of sequelae to around 20% among survivors. We have developed an intrauterine fetoscopic surgical treatment for TTTS. A 2‐mm endoscope and a diode laser fiber are introduced percutaneously, under local anesthesia, through a single 3‐mm trocard Coagulation of feto‐fetal anastomoses on the chorionic plate leads to the survival of at least one twin in around 80% of cases at 33 weeks. Fewer than 10% of survivors have sequelae, mainly related to prematurity. We conducted a randomized controlled trial that confirmed the superiority of laser therapy over amnioreduction. The long‐term outlook of these infants is good, with up to 6 years of follow‐up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patient concerns: A 44-year-old male patient with recurrent epistaxis underwent surgery for hemostasis. The patient aspirated blood through the endotracheal tube when he hiccupped during the surgery. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with blood aspiration after intraoperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a blood clot and viscous mucus in the airways, but no sign of active bleeding. Interventions: Tracheobronchial suctioning and irrigation with normal saline was performed through the bronchoscope to remove the aspirated blood clot. Prior to emergence from anesthesia, sugammadex was administered to induce complete neuromuscular recovery and enable the patient to cough up any blood remaining in the airways. Outcomes: The patient was successfully extubated and fully recovered with no complications. Lessons: Blood aspiration due to oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal bleeding can be diagnosed and treated by tracheobronchial suctioning via fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In addition, sugammadex can enable patients to recover spontaneous breathing, facilitate extubation, and enable patients to cough up any blood remaining in the airways.

In children, however, the prevalence, course, and significance of post-liver transplantation thrombocytopenia are not described. Therefore, we aimed to assess this phenomenon in children. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children who underwent liver transplantation at a single tertiary center between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS: Overall, 130 pediatric liver transplantations were reviewed. During the first 28 POD, thrombocytopenia was evident in 116 (89%, 95% CI 83%-94%). The median nadir platelet count was 54 K/μl (IQR: 37-99). Nadir platelet count was reached in half the patients by the third POD (IQR: 1-6). In multivariate analysis, preoperative platelet count (p = .024), volume of intraoperative packed cell transfusion (p = .045), and hypersplenism (p = .007) were associated with lower postoperative platelet counts. Patients with platelet count lower than the 50th centile on the first POD suffered from a more complicated course leading to a longer PICU admission (p = .039). CONCLUSIONS: Early post-liver transplant thrombocytopenia appears to be common in children and associated with preoperative thrombocytopenia, hypersplenism, and higher intraoperative blood transfusion volumes. A low first POD platelet count (<86 K/μl) was found to be independently associated with a more complicated postoperative course, suggesting the need for heightened surveillance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

A randomized study of transfusion is required to gain insight on best transfusion practices in this population. Methods: In preparation for our trial, all adult transplant centres associated with the Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group (CBMTG)(n = 15) were asked to respond to a survey regarding transfusion thresholds. Fourteen centres routinely transfuse 2 units of RBCs when the hemoglobin<80 g/L and/or in response to patient specific indications while one centre transfuses RBCs when the hemoglobin <70 g/L. The rationale for the near universal adoption of red cell transfusion trigger of 80 g/L remains unclear. Our centre has historically adopted a red cell transfusion trigger of 80 g/L and we conducted an audit of our practices for the year 2009. Despite our established trigger of 80 g/L, RBC transfusions above this trigger occurred in 50% of all transplant patients ever requiring red cells within the 1st 100 days of the transplant. Further, 20% of all RBC transfusions occurred above the stated trigger. Results: Two of 5 invited CBMTG centres declined participation for logistical reasons. In 3 centres, 100 patients undergoing HSCT will be randomized to either a restrictive (target hemoglobin of 70- 90g/L) or liberal (target hemoglobin of 90-110g/L) RBC transfusion strategy, based on daily hemoglobin values up to 100 days post-transplant. The primary goal is to demonstrate study feasibility while collecting clinical outcomes on 1) Transfusion Requirements, 2) Transplant Related Mortality, 3) Maximum grade of acute Graft versus Host Disease, 4) Veno-occlusive Disease, 5) Serious Infections, 6) Bearman Toxicity Score, 7) Bleeding, 8) Quality of Life, 9) Number of Hospitalizations and Intensive Care Unit admissions. At the time of writing, 25 patients have been followed for 28 days post HSCT, with our 1st Data Safety Monitoring Board review pending. Conclusion: No CBMTG centre has clearly embraced a liberal transfusion strategy and only 1 centre has embarked on a more restrictive strategy. This indicates some relative uncertainty with regards to the benefits and harms of RBC transfusion in the HSCT population. Upon completion, this pilot trial will provide. preliminary insight into RBC transfusion practice and its influence on HSCT outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Furthermore, recipient with HA and PV initial reperfusion were both hospitalized for a median of 8.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 6.5 to 15.5 vs. 7.0 to 14.0 days, respectively) and were both in ICU for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2 to 7 vs. 2 to 4 days, respectively). HA initial reperfusion was associated with significantly less intraoperative PRBC transfusion (median, 11.9 units; IQR, 11.1 to 13.1 units vs. 15.5 units; IQR, 12.9 to 17.9 units, p<0.001). The two groups did not differ in terms of patient and graft survival. Conclusion: Initial reperfusion of liver allografts with arterial, rather than portal, blood has theoretical benefits to hemodynamic stability, did not have deleterious effects on outcomes, and resulted in less blood utilization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A total of 180 children requiring packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were randomized into two groups: the liberal transfusion strategy group (transfusion trigger < 10 g/dL, Group 1) and the restrictive transfusion strategy group (transfusion trigger≤7 g/dL, Group 2). Basal variables including venous/arterial hemoglobin, hematocrit and lactate levels; stroke volume; and cardiac output were recorded at the beginning and end of the transfusion. Oxygen saturation, noninvasive total hemoglobin, noninvasive total oxygen content, perfusion index (PI), heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were assessed via the Radical-7 Pulse co-oximeter (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA) with the Root monitor, initially and at 4 h. Results: In all, 160 children were eligible for final analysis. The baseline hemoglobin level for the PRBC transfusion was 7.3860.98 g/dL for all patients. At the end of the PRBC transfusion, cardiac output decreased by 9.9% in Group 1 and by 24% in Group 2 (p < 0.001); PI increased by 10% in Group 1 and by 45% in Group 2 (p < 0.001). Lactate decreased by 9.8% in Group 1 and by 31.68% in Group 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Restrictive blood transfusion strategy is better than liberal transfusion strategy with regard to the hemodynamic and laboratory values during the early period. PI also provides valuable information regarding the efficacy of PRBC transfusion in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used to reduce blood loss and deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients and patients with postpartum hemorrhage. This study aimed to investigate the effect of TXA in reducing bleeding and complications during and after surgery in women with PAS. Materials and Methods: This double‐blind clinical trial was performed on 46 women who underwent cesarean section with PAS diagnosis. The participants were randomly assigned in two groups (n=23/each): the TXA group received 1 g TXA intravenously and the control group received 50 mL of normal saline immediately after the surgery. Then, the postoperative estimated blood loss (EBL), amount of blood products transfusion, complications during and after delivery, including the need for hysterectomy, duration of hospitalization, and the number of days staying in the intensive care unit (ICU) were compared between the two groups Results: The mean EBL during and after surgery in the TXA group was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.0001). The TXA group received fewer blood products, including packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet. The duration of surgery, duration of hospitalization, and the number of days in the ICU were significantly lower in the TXA group (P < 0.001). Hysterectomy was observed in 10 participants of the TXA group and 13 women in the control group, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.556). Conclusions: TXA administration effectively reduced postpartum hemorrhage, the need for postpartum blood transfusion, the duration of surgery, and the duration of hospitalization in women with PAS. TXA is a practical, inexpensive, safe, and readily available treatment and can be recommended as a prophylactic intervention to prevent blood loss in women with PAS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Survey results suggest that US neonatologists frequently administer platelet transfusions to VLBW infants with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Objectives: To characterize platelet transfusion practices in US neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), to determine whether severity of illness influences platelet transfusion decisions, and to examine the association between platelet count (PCT) and the risk for IVH in the first 7 days of life. Design, setting, and participants: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 972 VLBW infants treated in 6 US NICUs, with admission dates from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007. Data were collected from all infants until NICU discharge or death (last day of data collected, December 4, 2008). Data were entered into the central database, cleaned, and analyzed from May 1, 2009, to February 11, 2016. Intervention: Platelet transfusion. Main outcomes and measures: Number of platelet transfusions and incidence of IVH. Results: Among the 972 VLBW infants (520 [53.5%] male; mean [SD] gestational age, 28.2 [2.9] weeks), 231 received 1002 platelet transfusions (mean [SD], 4.3 [6.0] per infant; range, 1-63 per infant). The pretransfusion PCT was at least 50 000/μL for 653 of 998 transfusions (65.4%) with this information. Two hundred eighty-one transfusions (28.0%) were given during the first 7 days of life. During that period, platelet transfusions were given on 35 of 53 days (66.0%) when the patient had a PCT less than 50 000/μL and on 203 of 436 days (46.6%) when the patient had a PCT of 50 000/μL to 99 000/μL. At least 1 marker of severe illness was present on 198 of 212 patient-days (93.4%) with thrombocytopenia (PCT, <100 000/μL) when a platelet transfusion was given compared with 113 of 190 patient-days (59.5%) with thrombocytopenia when no platelet transfusion was given. Thrombocytopenia was a risk factor for intraventricular hemorrhage during the first 7 days of life (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.53-3.08; P < .001). However, no correlation was found between severity of thrombocytopenia and risk for IVH. After controlling for significant clinical factors and thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions did not have a significant effect on the incidence of IVH (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.49-1.73; P = .80). Conclusions and relevance: A large proportion of platelet transfusions were given to VLBW infants with PCT greater than 50 000/μL. Severity of illness influenced transfusion decisions. However, the severity of thrombocytopenia did not correlate with the risk for IVH, and platelet transfusions did not reduce this risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

It may be considered as an idiosyncratic, drug-induced reaction in which heparin injections result in the formation of complexes with platelet factor 4 (PF4), triggering an antibody-mediated reaction in certain individuals. Low platelet count in this instance is secondary to platelet aggregation and can lead to thrombotic complications by vascular occlusion and other mechanisms. Early recognition of this complication is essential to prevent life- and limb-threatening thrombosis. Therefore, it is important that intensive care physicians who administer heparin in different forms are aware of this potential adverse event and follow a regular plan in monitoring the platelet count while the patient is on heparin. In a patient whose platelet count falls while on heparin, when no other diagnostic possibilities can easily explain it, immediate withdrawal of any form of heparin and commencement of an alternative anticoagulant is necessary until the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed or excluded. At the same time, it is important that over-diagnosis of HIT is not made to avoid unwanted bleeding complications from the alternative anticoagulants. This review outlines the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of HIT with a focus on the intensive care setting. © The Intensive Care Society 2010.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study aimed to identify changes in functional status among older adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational cohort study conducted at a level IV private hospital in Brazil. METHODS: Patients were assessed using the Katz and Lawton scales and the Functional Independence Measure before admission, at hospital discharge and one month after discharge. Repeated-measurement analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: Two patients died during hospitalization. Among the 31 patients included, the Functional Independence Measure ranged from 121.7 ± 7.4 (pre-admission) to 91.1 ± 20.5 (discharge) and 109.0 ± 21.7 (one month after discharge); the Katz scale from 5.92 ± 0.32 to 4.18 ± 1.04 and 5.13 ± 1.30; and the Lawton scale from 24.3 ± 4.6 to 12.8 ± 2.0 and 16.5 ± 4.6 (P = 0.0001). When subgroups with (18) and without (13) complications were compared, the Functional Independence Measure (P = 0.085) showed a trend, although not significantly, toward recovery one month after discharge. Delirium and blood transfusion were the intercurrent events found. There was a correlation between the scales and age (P = 0.008), APACHE II (P = 0.051), EuroSCORE (P = 0.064), intensive care unit stay (P = 0.024) and overall hospital length of stay (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: The Functional Independence Measure proved to be a promising tool for monitoring the functional status of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, especially in the subgroup with complications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We aimed to present our initial clinical experience and show the feasibility and safety of RAT approach for ascending aorta surgery with or without aortic valve involvement. Methods: This single center study was included 112 patients who underwent ascending aortic replacement with or without aortic valve intervention, between September 2018 and December 2021. RAT was performed for 48 (42.9%) patients and conventional median sternotomy was performed for 64 (57.1%) patients. The primary endpoints included operative variables (total operation time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamping time), reoperation for bleeding, transfusion requirements and postoperative complications. Secondary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Results: Of the 112 patients, 48 (42.9%) were treated by using a minimally invasive right anterior thoracotomy approach, and the remaining 64 (57.1%) were treated by using a standard sternotomy approach. Mean age of patients was 67.63±6.67 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Mean logistic EuroScore II was 2.24±0.81. There was no significant difference between two groups in demographic data. . When we compared the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, aortic cross clamping (ACC) time and hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) time as we expected, there were no significant differences between two groups. Total operating time was statistically significant lower in favor of RAT group (237.84±24.87 min vs 259.57±27.41 min, respectively, P=0.0001). When we compared the postoperative variables of patients between the RAT group and the sternotomy group, the mean ventilation time (12.73±2.96 hours versus 19.43±4.21 hours) and the mean ICU length of stay (1.71±0.86 days versus 3.6±1.71 days) were both shorter in the RAT group (P<0.0001 for both).length of hospital was significantly shorter in RAT group compared to sternotomy group (7.48±0.91 days versus 10.6±1.43 days, P<0.0001), hospital mortality was similar between two groups. Conclusions: Right anterolateral mini-thoracotomy is a novel and promising approach for ascending aortic surgery with or without aortic valve involvement. This study suggests that this approach is both feasible and safe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

decline a blood transfusion poses unique challenges. The literature is scant for guiding perioperative anaemia management in these patients. We present a systematic review of this patient group, along with illustrative, consecutive case reports of our experience. Methods: A systematic review was performed on Embase, MEDLINE and PubMed databases on articles discussing the treatment of burn-injured Jehovah's Witness patients. Articles were excluded if discussing isolated inhalation injury, or if blood transfusions were permitted. Results: Nine articles including a total of 11 patients revealed consistent themes. A multimodal medical and surgical approach is suggested. Medical strategies are directed at reducing blood loss and optimising haematopoiesis and include rationalising blood collection, reversing coagulopathy, administering tranexamic acid and regular erythropoietin. Surgical strategies include staged aggressive debridement, tumescent adrenaline infiltration and limb tourniquets. We found that the argon beam coagulator was an effective haemostatic adjunct not previously described in literature. Discussion: Management of anaemia in severely burn-injured Jehovah's Witness patients is challenging. This systematic review presents a summary of strategies directed at minimising blood loss, and optimising haematopoiesis. Careful preoperative planning, meticulous surgical technique, and postoperative physiological support are caveats to success.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Possible clinical manifestations include: intracranial hemorrhage, umbilical cord bleeding at birth, hematoma, miscarriages and menorrhagia. Aims : To present two different clinical cases with FXIII Deficiency. Methods : Case 1: A 32-year-old man was referred to a hematology service with the main complaint of coagulation disturb. The patient reported splenectomy post trauma and denied major bleeding after tooth extraction. In September 2020, the patient had extensive spontaneous hematoma on the right thigh when he received a transfusion of cryoprecipitate, despite normal coagulation tests. He has family's history for bleeding disorder. Case 2: A 35 year-old female was referred to hematological investigation due to a bleeding disorder. The patient reported increased umbilical cord bleeding at birth, which required blood transfusion. After a traumatic brain injury in a mild car accident in 2012, the patient evolved with intracranial bleeding, with platelet unities transfusion. Nevertheless, the laboratory screening tests, showed normal results for coagulation disorders. Family history was negative for coagulation disorder. Results : Both patients were O positive blood type. The diagnostic laboratory tests are described in Table 1. It was still performed complete factor dosages (Factors X, XI, XII), research on inhibitors, whole blood count and lupus anticoagulant, with all the results within the normal range. In Case 2, the radiographic image is illustrated in Figure 1. The Case 1 patient is under control and has regular follow ups, while the Case 2 patient receives monthly prophylactic treatment with FXIII.

Fibrinogen concentrate (FC) can control bleeding without causing viral complications and without volume loading, which can happen in transfusion-associated circulatory overload and transfusion-associated acute lung injury. FC application is easy and does not require dissolution or extra devices. It is a cost-effective agent when considering the blood and products used in large quantities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 67 postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and trauma patients’ medical records, who had ASA I-III classification (The American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of physical status), were obtained. Patients were divided into two groups (fibrinogen level ≤ 100 mg/dl and ≥ 101 mg/dl). The following information was obtained from patient files: demographic parameters, history of operations, and laboratory findings (i.e., complete blood counts, coagulation tests, and fibrinogen levels). Also, the duration of intensive care unit stays and mechanical ventilation application days, the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), erythrocytes, platelets, and FC numbers, and tranexamic acid infusion were recorded. RESULTS: There was no mortality in PPH patients in either group (fibrinogen level ≤ 100 mg/ dl and ≥ 101 mg/dl). The mortality rate in trauma patients was significantly higher in the group with fibrinogen levels ≤ 100. A total of 170 g of FC were given to PPH patients and 92 g to trauma patients. There were statistically significant differences between the preoperative PT (pro-thrombin time), postoperative APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), postoperative PT, and postoperative INR (international normalized ratio) levels of the patients in the group with fibrinogen levels ≤ 100. Mortality rates were also significantly higher, and hospital stays significantly longer in trauma patients in the group with fibrinogen levels ≤ 100. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy may be considered during massive bleeding and transfusion, as it can help to increase fibrinogen levels quickly and efficiently. Compared with FFP, fibrinogen concentrate may have some advantages in reducing the risk of fluid overload. FFP contains a range of clotting factors, including fibrinogen. It also contains other proteins and fluids that can lead to fluid overload, especially when given in large volumes during massive transfusions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Importance: Trauma patients are at increased risk of unmet palliative care needs for many reasons. Objective(s): Develop a predictive algorithm that triggers a palliative care consult for trauma patients that can be automated within the electronic medical record. Method(s): A total of 2197 admitted patients involved in tier 1-3 trauma activations between 2014-2016 were identified from our trauma registry. Variables of clinical relevance to trauma patients were compiled from the literature and extracted from the EMR and included demographics, labs, trauma/clinical scoring systems, injuries, and comorbid conditions. We implemented a machine learning approach with 10-fold repeated cross-validation to identify predictor variables conveying the greatest odds of association with a palliative care consult using the R statistical environment. Results: Eight different machine learning models (including logistic regression, neural network, decision tree, and random forest) were implemented. A total of 32 candidate predictor variables served as inputs for all models and yielded [minimum, maximum] sensitivities of [0.78, 0.99], specificities of [0.79, 0.99] and AUC of [0.87, 0.99] across validation folds. Variables predictive of a palliative care consult included age, TRISS, GCS, intubation status, transfusion status, QSOFA score, admission to ICU, abnormal hemoglobin, abnormal blood urea nitrogen, abnormal white blood cells, and comorbid conditions including CHF, neurological disease, and cancer. Conclusion(s): Our research reveals that data extracted from the EMR can aid in the identification and prioritization of trauma patients for palliative care consultation. Impact: We demonstrate a machine learning approach capable of identifying trauma patients with unmet palliative care needs, while circumventing the need for additional staff devoted to manually screening all patients admitted each day to the hospital.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Transfusion of older red blood cells (RBCs) has been implicated in poor outcomes in trauma, cardiac surgery, and critically ill patients. However, whether transfusion of older RBCs plays any role in post-OLT AKI remained unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the age of transfused RBCs on post-OLT AKI. METHODS: The clinical data of consecutive adult patients who received donation after cardiac death and underwent OLT from December 2011 to December 2015 were analyzed. These patients were divided into 2 groups: the newer blood group, who received exclusively RBCs that had been stored for <14 days; and the older blood group, who received RBCs that had been stored for 14 days or more. The incidence of post-OLT AKI, severe AKI, lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality after OLT were analyzed. RESULTS: Postoperative AKI occurred in 65.1% of patients in the older blood group and 40.5% of patients in the newer blood group (P < .01). The incidence of severe AKI after OLT was significantly higher, and the duration of intensive care unit stay was significantly longer, in the older blood group. After adjustment by the multivariable regression logistic analysis, transfusion of older blood was independently associated with post-OLT AKI (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.13-5.41]; P = .024) and severe AKI (OR = 5.88 [95% CI, 2.06-16.80]; P = .001). After adjustment by the inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, patients in the older blood group still had significantly higher incidences of postoperative AKI (OR = 2.13 [95% CI, 1.07-4.22]; P = .030) and severe AKI (OR = 3.34 [95% CI, 1.47-7.60]; P = .003) than those in the newer blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion of older RBCs significantly increased the risk of postoperative AKI in liver transplant recipients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DAH pathogenesis is not clearly defined, but it is related to SLE disease activity, involving immune complex deposits and cellular infiltrate in pulmonary vessels leading to pulmonary capillaritis. It may present itself with or without hemoptysis and the treatment consists in pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin, rituximab and cyclophosphamide, which has its use linked to controversy. Case report: Female, 26 years old, was admitted to the hospital with a 1 month history of dyspnea at rest, dry cough, anasarca, anemia and butterfly rash. She had been experiencing asthenia, hair loss, arthralgia and oral ulcers for one year. Laboratory workup on admission were 6.3g/dL hemoglobin, negative direct coombs test, positive ANA 1/640 (mixed, nuclear, nucleolar and cytoplasmic pattern), positive anti-DNA and anti-RNP, 3+ dipstick urine protein, and urinary protein/creatinine ratio of 9.4. HIV, VDRL and hepatitis-related serology tested negative. She was initially diagnosed with SLE and Lupus Nephritis. Chest CT scan (Fig. 1) was performed with resulting images suggestive of Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP). The patient then progressed to severe anemia (3.8g/dL Hemoglobin) without presenting hematemesis or melena, being managed with blood transfusion and a 3-day pulse therapy of 1g methylprednisolone plus cyclophosphamide. On the 20th day from admission, the patient displayed hemoptisis of roughly 20mL, in spite of our therapeutic measures. Hematic fluids were observed on the performed Bronchoscopy. She was then, transferred to ICU and treated with 0.4mg/Kg human immunoglobulin daily for 5 days, with good response and stabilization of hemoglobin levels around 6.5g/dL. However, the patient progressed to massive hemoptysis, respiratory and renal insufficiency within 1 week of immunoglobulin infusion, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. She also experienced enterococcus septic shock, passing away while in ICU. Conclusion: DAH is considered a severe complication of SLE. We warn the possibility of its initial clinical presentation consisting mainly of dyspnea associated with anemic syndrome, without hemoptisis. DAH is known to be associated with active lupus nephritis and high morbidity and mortality rates, as reported on this case.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

From all patients with cerebral thromboembolic events, 74 (48%) were splenectomized. Cerebral thromboembolic events were reported after transfusion in six β-thalassemia major, and two β-thalassemia intermedia patients. Three β-thalassemia major patients had irregular transfusion and 22 β-thalassemia intermedia patients were not transfused. Thrombocytosis were determined in 11 β-thalassemia major, and 15 β-thalassemia intermedia patients. Cardiomyopathy was present in 13 β-thalassemia major and four β-thalassemia intermedia patients. Also, nine β-thalassemia major patients had diabetes. Activated protein C resistant, decreased protein C or protein S or plasminogen level was detected in eight β-thalassemia major patients. Cerebral involvement appears to be associated with increasing age, transfusion naivety, splenectomy, thrombocytosis, intensive transfusion, decreased protein C level, and having risk factors for cerebrovascular accident such as cardiomyopathy, and diabetes. In light of these findings, diagnostic MRI is recommended in high-risk groups to screen for early asymptomatic brain damage. If brain ischemia is found, the administration of antiplatelet aggregants or blood transfusion is likely to be beneficial. In addition, in thalassemic patients who complicated with a thromboembolic event, secondary prophylaxis could be helpful to prevent cerebral thromboembolic events. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 287 children with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) were divided into the 'normal' (NG), 'linear fracture' (LFG) and 'intraparenchymal injury' groups (IPG) based on head CT findings. Demographical/clinical data and laboratory results were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was markedly higher in the LFG (p = 0.010 and p = 0.016, respectively) and IPG (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively) compared with NG. Lower lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (p = 0.044) and higher red cell distribution width-platelet ratio (RPR) (p = 0.030) were associated with intraparenchymal injuries. Patients requiring neurosurgical intervention had higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.026) and RPR values (p = 0.031) and lower platelet counts (p = 0.035). Lower levels of erythrocytes (p = 0.005), hemoglobin (p = 0.003) and hematocrit (p = 0.002) were associated with severe TBI and unfavorable outcome (p = 0.012, p = 0.004 and p = 0.006, respectively).

Material and methods: Based on the evidence available for the enhanced recovery program, we build a multidisciplinary team for the ERAS implementation. 21 items (from 25 items report from the ERAS Society for perioperative care in elective rectal/pelvic surgery) of the multimodal perioperative care pathway was established in patients undergoing RARC with intracorporal urinary diversion. The primary outcome was the surgical complications, postoperative intensive care readmission, time to pass stool and length of hospital stay. Results: 27 patients underwent RARC with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), in 17 patients urinary diversion was an ileal conduit and in 10 patients a neobladder. No intraoperative complications were noted. Early Clavien grade IIIa complications had 2 patients. 4 Patients were readmitted to the intensive care unit. Median postoperative first passage of stool was 3.5 days. Postoperativ nasogastric tube placement was in 2 patients necessary. In 4 patients we performed a gastrointestinal contrast study. In the first 3 postoperative days the median fluid intak was as followed: day 1 = 4498 ml, day 2 = 3035 ml, day 3 = 3050 ml. Blood transfusion was not necessary in any case. The mean length of hospital stay was 12.3 days (range 8-19 days). Conclusions: The implementation of ERAS protocol in our RARC program was efficient without increasing the complication risk. The success depends on previous intensive preparation and good teamwork (nurses, diet assistant, physiotherapist, anesthesiologists and surgeons).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim of this study was to analyze a cohort of severe trauma patients to identify risk factors associated with massive transfusion requirements and hypocalcemia. All major trauma (ISS > 16) presented directly from the scene to the Niguarda hospital between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2021 were analyzed. A total of 798 patients were eligible out of 1586 screened. Demographic data showed no significant difference between hypocalcemic (HC) and normocalcemic (NC) patients except for the presence of crush trauma, alcohol intake (27% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), and injury severity score (odds ratio 1.03, p = 0.03). ISS was higher in the HC group and was an independent, even if weak, predictor of hypocalcemia (odds ratio 1.03, p = 0.03). Prehospital data showed a lower mean systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and a higher heart rate (HR) in the HC group (105 vs. 127, p < 0.01; 100 vs. 92, p < 0.001, respectively), resulting in a higher shock index (SI) (1.1 vs. 0.8, p < 0.001). Only retrospective studies such as ours are available, and while hypocalcemia seems to be an independent predictor of mortality and massive transfusion, there is not enough evidence to support causation. Therefore, randomized prospective studies are suggested.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Knowledge of oxygen saturation in this region provides early warning for potential cerebral ischaemia [1]. In this study we evaluated the effects of intraoperative NIRS usage on postoperative neurocognitive functions in patients who had undergone CABG. Method: One hundred patients between 18‐ 65 yr of age were included in our study. After the approval of the ethical committee and patients' consent, patients were randomized into two groups, Group I and Group II (control group) with equal numbers. INVOS were used for cerebral oximeter monitoring and basal NIRS measurements were taken in both groups. During surgery, pump blood flow was between 2.2‐2.4 L min‐1 m‐2 and mean arterial pressure was between 50‐80 mmHg. Despite adequate depth of anaesthesia, in cases of high blood pressure, a vasodilator and with low levels, a vasopressor (ephedrine) were used. Intraoperative haematocrit was targeted to be between 20‐ 25%. In group I when a 20% decrease from baseline NIRS monitor was detected, FiO2 was raised to 100%, PaCO2 aimed to be 40‐ 45 mmHg and mean arterial pressure to be 70‐80 mmHg. The pump blood flow was increased to 2.5 L min‐1 m‐2, depth of anaesthesia increased, and 10‐30 μg kg‐1 min‐1 nitroglycerine was started in order to increase cerebral blood flow. Erythrocytes were given when the haematocrit was below 20%. In group 2, without any evidence of NIRS values, management was maintained in accordance with clinical practice and experience. In case of hypotension, the mean arterial blood pressure aimed to be increased to 70‐ 80 mmHg. For this purpose, pump blood flow was raised to 2.5 L min‐1 m‐2, if necessary ephedrine or epinephrine was administered, FiO2 was 100%, and erythrocytes were given when the haematocrit value was below 20%. The preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive tests were performed in all patients at the 5th day. Results: Although significant statistical differences were not detected between the two groups except at certain periods, extubation time, ICU length of stay and duration of total hospitalization were statistically significantly shorter in group I. CPB time and operation time were shorter coincidentally and postop erative blood loss was significantly less in these cases. Additionally, when NIRS values were examined again, except 80th min. values, we obtained high values of group I during the entire operation. Discussion: It is really difficult to say that these differences have come from the use of NIRS. We think that this study should be repeated and supported with studies that have more patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

widely recognized risk factor for secondary brain damage and contributes to poor clinical outcomes. Various theories, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), have been proposed regarding its pathomechanisms; no consensus has been reached thus far. This study aimed to elucidate the pathophysiology of TBI-induced coagulopathy by comparing coagulofibrinolytic changes in isolated TBI (iTBI) to those in non-TBI, to determine the associated factors, and identify the clinical significance of DIC diagnosis in patients with iTBI. Methods: This secondary multicenter, prospective study assessed patients with severe trauma. iTBI was defined as Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores ≥4 in the head and neck, and ≤2 in other body parts. Non-TBI was defined as AIS scores ≥4 in single body parts other than the head and neck, and the absence of AIS scores ≥3 in any other trauma-affected parts. Specific biomarkers for thrombin and plasmin generation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolysis inhibition were measured at the presentation to the emergency department (0 h) and 3 h after arrival. Results: We analyzed 34 iTBI and 40 non-TBI patients. Baseline characteristics, transfusion requirements and in-hospital mortality did not significantly differ between groups. The changes in coagulation/fibrinolysis-related biomarkers were similar. Lactate levels in the iTBI group positively correlated with DIC scores (rho = −0.441, p = 0.017), but not with blood pressure (rho = −0.098, p = 0.614). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the injury severity score was an independent predictor of DIC development in patients with iTBI (odds ratio = 1.237, p = 0.018). Patients with iTBI were further subdivided into two groups: DIC (n = 15) and non-DIC (n = 19) groups. Marked thrombin and plasmin generation were observed in all patients with iTBI, especially those with DIC. Patients with iTBI and DIC had higher requirements for massive transfusion and emergency surgery, and higher in-hospital mortality than those without DIC. Furthermore, DIC development significantly correlated with poor hospital survival; DIC scores at 0 h were predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Methods: This hospital based prospective observational study was conducted in a Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Laheriasarai, Darbhanga, Bihar, India over a period of 12 months from February 2019 to January 2020. A total of 200 Neonates under the age of 28 days admitted in NICU, were studied and 100 at risk neonates’ were detected and included in our study. Results: Most common presentation in EOS is respiratory distress, and in LOS is refusal of feeds, and over all common presentation is refusal of feeds. Total 200 neonates were examined. 100 neonates (50%) were at risk. 12 (12%) were had no sepsis (NOS), 40 (40%) were Early onset sepsis (EOS) and 48 (48%) were Late onset sepsis (LOS). In EOS, thrombocytopenia was found in 80%, whereas it was 83.34% in LOS. It was seen that thrombocytopenia was the most sensitive marker (83.08%) followed by MPV and PDW in detecting neonates with culture‑positive sepsis. However, it has a low specificity (20.33%). But when we combine MPV and PDW or combined all the three markers (MPV + PDW + PC), the specificity increased to 46.34%. Conclusion: NNT can be used as screening tool in NNS as it is easy and cost effective. It requires further large scale studies and meta-analysis to validate. Mortality in sepsis cases increases with severity of thrombocytopenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Some patients needed ICU and respiratory support. Some patients only had flu-like symptoms. Cytokine storm and elevated ROS were serious problems for treatment. Apoptotic genes and CYP Family are part of these mechanisms. Aim: In this study, our aim was to examine the gene expression CYP2E1 and Caspase-3 in patients with COVID-19 infection. Method: 60 COVID-19(+) patients (ICU and non-ICU patients) and 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled to study. To measure the level of gene expression qPCR was used. The 2-ΔΔCt method was utilized to analyze gene expression. Results: The expression of CYP2E1 and Caspase-3 genes showed a significant discrepancy between patients and healthy individuals. Caspase-3 expression increased (p=0,0041) but CYP2E1 expression decreased (p=0,0214) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. Both levels of gene expression were lower in patients with affected lungs than patients with unaffected lungs (p<0,05). Laboratory findings including d-Dimer, LDH, platelet count, lymphocyte count were related to both gene expressions (p<0,05). We found no correlation between CYP2E1 and Caspase-3 expressions. Conclusion: The expression of Caspase-3 demonstrated apoptotic situations of patients but was not related to the CYP2E1 expression level. CYP2E1 gene expression is an important actor to metabolize endogens and xenobiotics however, COVID-19 patients demonstrated decreased CYP2E1 expression. CYP2E1 and Caspase-3 gene expression levels may be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

CASES REPORT: Case n. 1: The death of one twin and enlargement of the ventricular system in the other were seen by ultrasonography at 24 weeks of pregnancy, 8 weeks after the mother had a fall on the stairs. The heterogeneous imaging in the inferior part of placenta suggested a clot in this area. The pregnancy was terminated at 28 weeks because the ventricular dilatation continued to increase. The newborn died a few minutes later and examination of the placenta showed that the pregnancy was monochorionic and monoamniotic. Case n. 2: The death of one twin with macerating features was seen by ultrasonography at 31 weeks. The other twin was born at 32 weeks of a dichorionic, diamniotic pregnancy. Injection of milk into the placental vasculature failed to visualize any vascular anastomoses between the two placentas, but ultrasonography showed bilateral cystic lesions in the frontal lobes of the brain. Case n. 3: Acute polyhydramnios developed at 21 weeks of pregnancy; it was treated by 3 amniocenteses, while ultrasonography of the twins was normal. A fetal transfusion syndrome was observed at birth, the pregnancy being monochorionic and diamniotic. Cranial ultrasound on day 6 was normal in the recipient twin, but showed numerous cerebral cavities in the donor, which was confirmed at autopsy after that this twin suddenly died at 2 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Brain lesions of vascular origin, can be observed in any type of twin pregnancies. They may be the result of transfusion of clot or thromboplastin-rich blood from the donor fetus through vascular anastomoses in a monochorionic placenta. They also may be due to anoxo-ischemic lesions in the absence of such anastomoses, or, in the fetal transfusion syndrome, to circulatory difficulties in one of the twins, as observed in premature singletons. In the cas of anoxo-ischemic lesions, anticipating the birth of the surviving twin is not justified.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study was designed to investigate the effects of red blood cell transfusion according to the hematocrit on the clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery. METHODS: The 433 patients who were undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to two groups. One group was transfused red blood cells with a hematocrit of 20%, and the other group was transfused red blood cells with a hematocrit of 20 25%. The amounts of intraoperative and postoperative transfusion and various parameters of the clinical outcomes were checked. RESULTS: In the hematocrit <20% group, the amount of infused crystalloid during operation was larger than that of the hematocrit >20% group, and the postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit were lower than that of the hematocrit >20% group. But there were no differences of the amounts of intraoperative and postoperative transfusion, the use of inotropics, the platelet count, the prothrombin time (PT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and creatine kinase MB (CK‐MB), the extubation time and the ICU stay time between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A hematocrit lower than 20% was tolerated by the cardiac surgical patients and it was not related to the postoperative morbidity and outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted over 1 year to the PICU of CHU Sainte-Justine were included after they received their first red blood cell transfusion. TACO was diagnosed using the criteria of the International Society of Blood Transfusion, with two different ways of defining abnormal values: 1) using normal pediatric values published in the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics and 2) by using the patient as its own control and comparing pre- and posttransfusion values with either 10 or 20% difference threshold. We monitored for TACO up to 24 hours posttransfusion. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were included. Using the “normal pediatric values” definition, we diagnosed 63, 88, and 104 patients with TACO at 6, 12, and 24 hours posttransfusion, respectively. Using the “10% threshold” definition we detected 4, 15, and 27 TACO cases in the same periods, respectively; using the “20% threshold” definition, the number of TACO cases was 2, 6, and 17, respectively. Chest radiograph was the most frequent missing item, especially at 6 and 12 hours posttransfusion. Overall, the incidence of TACO varied from 1.5% to 76% depending on the definition. CONCLUSION: A more operational definition of TACO is needed in PICU patients.

The literature is sparse on the outcomes of critically ill patients with TTP managed in intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to determine the mortality of ICU patients admitted with TTP and evaluate the predictors of survival. We also compared the incidence of nosocomial infection among those who did or did not receive plasma exchange (PE). Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary ICU. Two authors screened patients for eligibility from the hospital information system based on peripheral smear reports. Adult critically ill TTP patients managed in ICU were included. Patients with a diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, autoimmune causes of haemolysis and pregnancy-related conditions, etc. were excluded. Two authors extracted data from medical charts. No imputation of missing variables was done. Non-parametric statistics were used to report data. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16. Results Of the 535 records that were screened, 33 patients were deemed eligible. Mortality among TTP patients was 14 (42%). The women to men ratio was 7:3. At admission, greater degree of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors (5.4 g/dl [4.8-7.1] v. 7.6 g/dl [6.1-8.9], p=0.05; 17x103 μl v. 21x103 μl, p=0.63; and 2987 (1904-3614) U/L v. 2126 U/L (1941-3319), p=0.71; respectively]. Nineteen (57%) patients had acute kidney injury (AKI), of which 11 survived: 6 recovered completely from renal failure and 5 progressed to end-stage renal disease. Nosocomial infection rates were not different among those receiving and not receiving PE therapy (7 [33%] v. 3 [25%], respectively). Conclusion TTP is more common in women and has a high mortality. Older age, low haemoglobin and higher platelet transfusions are predictors of poor survival. Nosocomial infection rates were similar irrespective of receiving PE therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all women (18-45 years) with ARDS and confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted during the study period from May 2020 to July 2021. Pregnant women were considered as case and non-pregnant women as control. Primary outcomes included ventilatory support, the need for high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO), severe ARDS, and death. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, and requirement of oxygen at discharge. RESULTS: We included 59 women diagnosed with ARDS and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, of them 12 were pregnant and 47 were non-pregnant. The non-pregnant women were significantly older than pregnant women (28.7±5 versus 35.5±8.2, p=0.008). Presenting symptoms were comparable among the groups. Diabetes was significantly higher in the non-pregnant group (8.3% versus 31.9%, p<0.02). Pregnant women had a significantly higher range of D-dimer (5.8±7.2 versus 1.8±1.9, p<0.01) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (212.0±300.8 versus 49.7±57.7, p<0.011) and lower platelet count (129.4±120.1 versus 197.6±92.9, p<0.05) compared to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women were more likely to experience primary outcomes including the need for HFNO (33% versus 8.5%, odds ratio (OR): 5.3, p<0.02) and death (50% versus 31.9%, OR: 2.1, p<0.04) compared to non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 and ARDS were at an increased risk for experiencing ICU admission, intubation, and mechanical ventilation compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, although comorbidities such as diabetes were higher among the non-pregnant cohort. These findings suggest that pregnancy itself is a potential risk factor for complications and morbidities among women with severe COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Due to the lack of international guidelines specific for the intensive care unit (ICU), we hypothesized that a large heterogeneity in transfusion practice in this patient population exists. The aims of this study were to describe the current transfusion practices and identify the knowledge gaps. Methods: An online, anonymous, worldwide survey among ICU physicians was performed evaluating red blood cell, platelet and plasma transfusion practices. Furthermore, the presence of a hospital-or ICU-specific transfusion guideline was asked. Only completed surveys were analysed. Results: Nine hundred forty-seven respondents filled in the survey of which 725 could be analysed. Hospital transfusion protocol available in their ICU was reported by 53% of the respondents. Only 29% of respondents used an ICU-specific transfusion guideline. The reported haemoglobin (Hb) threshold for the general ICU population was 7 g/dL (7-7). The highest reported variation in transfusion threshold was in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with brain injury (8 g/dL (7.0-9.0)). Platelets were transfused at a median count of 20 × 109 cells/L IQR (10-25) in asymptomatic patients, but at a higher count prior to invasive procedures (p < 0.001). In patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) > 3, 43% and 57% of the respondents would consider plasma transfusion without any upcoming procedures or prior to a planned invasive procedure, respectively. Finally, doctors with base specialty in anaesthesiology transfused critically ill patients more liberally compared to internal medicine physicians. Conclusion: Red blood cell transfusion practice for the general ICU population is restrictive, while for different subpopulations, higher Hb thresholds are applied. Furthermore, practice in plasma and platelet transfusion is heterogeneous, and local transfusion guidelines are lacking in the majority of the ICUs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: In a retrospective, 1:1 propensity score–matched cohort study, 9070 patients were reviewed from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Propensity score matching and subgroup analysis were used. Results: In both groups (single-level and multilevel ALIF/LLIF), patients operated on by neurosurgeons had longer operative time (188 minutes vs. 172 minutes/239 minutes vs. 221 minutes); shorter total hospital stay (71 hours vs. 90 hours/89 hours vs. 96 hours); and lower rates of return to the operating room (2.1% vs. 4.1%/2.4% vs. 4.2%), nonhome discharge (8.7% vs. 11.1%/10.1% vs. 14.9%), discharge after postoperative day 3 (22.0% vs. 30.0%/38.0% vs. 43.9%), and perioperative blood transfusion (2.1% vs. 5.1%/5.0% vs. 9.9%) (P < 0.05). In multilevel ALIF/LLIF, patients operated on by neurosurgeons had lower readmission rates (3.9% vs. 6.9%) (P < 0.05). Other outcome measures and mortality rates were similar between the single-level and multilevel ALIF/LLIF cohorts regardless of surgeon specialty. Conclusions: Our analysis found significant differences in early perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing ALIF/LLIF by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. These differences have significant clinical and cost implications for patients, physicians, program directors, payers, and health systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We proposed to assess the association between hyperlactatemia and early post-operative outcome after off pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery. Materials and Methods: 350 consecutive patients undergoing OPCAB surgery were studied retrospectively. Early postoperative serum lactate level was measured in all patients, upon shifting the patient to the ICU (0 hours), at 6 hours and 12 hours. The primary outcome was a composite of 30day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity. A propensity model was constructed to overcome the baseline differences between the group with and without complications. Results: 32 (9.14%) patients had at least 1 complication, which was associated with significantly prolonged mechanical ventilation (38.6 h vs 12.8 h; p<0.001), and longer length of ICU stay (7.2 days vs 3.8 days; p<0.001).Propensity score matching yielded 23 pairs of cohorts with and without complications. Patients who developed complications, had higher serum lactate levels immediately after being shifted to the ICU (4.8 ± 0.6 Vs 2.9 ± 0.5; p < 0.001), at 6 hours (4.1 ± 0.5 Vs 2.3 ± 0.4; p < 0.001) and 12 hours (3.2 ± 0.5 Vs 1.8 ± 0.4; p < 0.001). Lactate levels of ≥ 3.65 mmol/L at 0 hours, ≥ 2.75 mmol/L at 6 hours and ≥ 2.25 mmol/L at 12 hours of ICU stay were associated with major post-operative complications. Amongst other intra- and postoperative variables, the rate of RBC transfusion was significantly higher in propensity matched cohort with complications (1.9 ± 0.3 Vs 1.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001).

Its detection, therefore, is an early and a very cost-effective marker in identifying patients at higher risk for adverse events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A Case control study was conducted in newborns admitted in NICU between February to June2009 .Cases(n = 71) were newborns with documented thrombocytopenia and who received at least one platelet transfusion.Controls(n = 49) were nonthrombocytopenic newborns admitted at the same period.Risk factors were compared. Mortality between those who received single dose of platelet transfusion and those who received ≥2 doses(taken as multitransfused) were compared. Data was analysed using chi-square test and Odd's ratio with 95% CI in SPSS ver.14 Results: Of the 1038 admissions in NICU, 240 babies (23.12%) developed thrombocytopenia but only 71 (6.84%) needed transfusion. Platelet transfusion was required in 29.5% of thrombocytopenic neonates. Majority received multiple transfusions (59.15%). Major riskfactors identified were Sepsis (P = 0.005, OR 7.9) Necrotising Enterocolitis (P = 0.000, OR 2.065), Hypoxia (P = 0.011, OR 6.492), and birth asphyxia (P = 0.038, OR 2.9). Mortality in those who received transfusion (33.8%) were significantly higher than those who received no transfusions (4.08%) (P = 0.000, OR 12.00)and mortality in multitransfused group was very high (50%) compared to single (10.34%) (P = 0.001, OR 12.056). Commonest cause of death was DIC (41.6%) followed by pulmonary haemorrhage (20.8%) Conclusions: Major risk factors associated with severe thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions were sepsis, NEC, fetal hypoxia and birth asphyxia. Multiple platelet transfusions in newborn were associated with high risk for death and can be taken as a marker for severity of underlying disease. Measures to reduce risk factors like control of sepsis, NEC prevention, good antenatal care and prompt management of fetal distress are recommended.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, even if chemoprophylaxis does not prevent clinical malaria in some individuals, it does lead to a reduction in the severity of the disease.1 In Sweden, we have recently seen five patients with malaria (three due to P. ovale and two due to P. falciparum) who have used homeopathic drugs for prophylaxis during visits to West Africa. We are concerned about this incidence and afraid that reduced confidence in modern medical malaria prophylaxis will encourage some individuals to try totally ineffective alternatives. Three women (57, 40, and 39 years old) visited Guinea Conacry in January 1995 as members of a group of 24 persons learning about African dances. The 57-year-old woman took mefloquine irregularly but vomited each time after intake. She also used Spenglersan M, which is a homeopathic drug that is administered (one drop daily in the bend of the arm) as malaria prophylaxis. The two other women used Spenglersan M only. They all fell ill with P. ovale malaria despite ongoing intake. Spenglersan M is said to contain both antigen from P. falciparum and antibodies against the parasite diluted to 1:1,000,000,000 concentration. The fourth case was a 26-year-old man who visited Ghana and Burkina Faso in October and November 1994. He used China D-6 for prophylaxis. This is a homeopathic preparation of the bark from the cinchona tree. Not even trace amounts of quinine were found in the tablets with a very sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method.2 Four days after returning from Africa he fell ill with P. falciparum malaria and received sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment. After clinical relapse (RI), mefloquine was given and the patient was eventually cured. The fifth case was a 34-year-old woman admitted to hospital because of P. falciparum malaria after a visit to Guinea Conacry in January 1995. She had taken a homeopathic drug, Charaka comp 118, as prophylaxis. The drug is said to contain different extracts from herbs diluted 30 times. At first she refused to stay in hospital, but 2 days later she was readmitted and treated in the intensive care unit because of severe malaria with hypotonia and anemia. She had hyperparasitemia with 23% infected erythrocytes. Exchange transfusion was done, quinine was given, and the patient recovered without sequelae. The mortality is about 1% in people with P. falciparum infection.3 We therefore urge the readers to stand up against the dangerous use of homeopathic drugs and instead motivate travelers to use protective malaria prophylaxis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

When undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF), NMS risks can be much higher than the idiopathic population. This study aimed to identify the impact of two experienced pediatric cosurgeons (CS) compared to a single spine surgeon (SS) on the intra- and postoperative results of NMS PSF. METHODS: A database of NMS patients who had undergone PSF 2016-2021 identified 53 patients, of which 32 were CS, while 21 were SS. Patients' sex, age, weight, diagnosis, curve severity, fusion performed, estimated blood loss (EBL), transfusion rates, hemoglobin, anesthesia and surgical times, length of stay, and complications were collected. RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar between groups. Curves were more severe in the CS group (p = 0.013). Intraoperatively, CS patients underwent larger corrections (p = 0.089) but in significantly shorter anesthetic (p = 0.0018) and operative (p = 0.0025) times. Blood loss and transfusions were similar. Postoperatively, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and length of stay (LOS) were similar, but SS had higher rates of both unplanned ICU admissions (p = 0.36) and 30 day readmissions (p = 0.053). Complications overall were similar between the groups both within 30 days (p = 0.40) and in the short-term period (31-90 days, p = 0.76), though the CS cohort had less Grade 2 immediate postoperative pulmonary complications (p = 0.16). CONCLUSION: Utilizing CS for NMS PSF has been found to reduce operative times. Downstream, additional potential impacts trended toward fewer unplanned ICU admissions, less-frequent postoperative pulmonary complications, and reduced 30-day readmission rates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

disease (ACHD) patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are prone to postoperative complications, and characterization of the risk profile continues to fail in identifying inflammatory predilection. Our objective is to investigate the role of platelet-leukocyte indices (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], platelet-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], and systemic immune-inflammation index [SII] [neutrophil × platelet/lymphocyte]) in predicting poor outcomes following cardiac surgery in ACHD cohort with preoperative PH. Methods: This single-center, retrospective risk-predictive study included ACHD patients undergoing surgical correction at our tertiary cardiac center between January 2015 and December 2019. Standard institutional perioperative management protocol was followed, and poor postoperative outcome was defined as ≥1 of: low cardiac output syndrome, new-onset renal failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV > 24 hours), stroke, sepsis, and/or death. Results: One hundred eighty patients out of 1,040 (17.3%) presented poor outcome. On univariate analysis, preoperative factors including right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (PH-severity marker), congestive heart failure, albumin, NLR, PLR, SII, and aortic cross-clamping (ACC) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times predicted poor outcome. However, on multivariate analysis, RVSP, NLR, SII, and ACC and CPB times emerged as independent predictors. An NLR, SII prognostic cutoff of 3.33 and 860.6×103/mm3 was derived (sensitivity: 77.8%, 78.9%; specificity: 91.7%, 82.2%; area under the curve: 0.871, 0.833). NLR and SII values significantly correlated with postoperative MV duration, mean vasoactive-inotropic scores, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay (P<0.001). Conclusion: Novel parsimonious, reproducible platelet-leukocyte indices present the potential of stratifying the risk in congenital cardiac surgical patients with pre-existing PH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Study design and methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in VLBW neonates in neonatal intensive care units between 2004 and 2016. VLBW (≤1500 grams) neonates were followed until discharge or in-hospital death. The primary exposure was ABO group. Secondary exposures included platelet count, plasma transfusions, and maternal ABO group. Outcome measures were NEC (defined as Bell stage ≥ 2) and all-cause mortality. Time-dependent Cox regression models with competing risks were used to investigate factors associated with NEC and mortality. Results: Thousand and sixteen neonates were included with 10.8% developing NEC (n = 110) and 14.1% mortality (n = 143). Platelet count (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.922–0.998) and number of plasma transfusions (HR = 2.908; 95% CI:1.265–6.682) were associated with NEC, while ABO group (non-O vs. O) was not (HR = 0.761; 95% CI: 0.393–1.471). Higher all-cause mortality occurred in neonates without NEC who were non-O compared with O (HR = 17.5; 95% CI: 1.784–171.692), but not in neonates with NEC (HR = 1.112; 95% CI: 0.142–8.841). Plasma transfusion was associated with increased mortality in both groups. Discussion: ABO non-identical transfusion was not associated with NEC or mortality in neonates with NEC. It was associated with increased mortality in neonates without NEC. As many neonatal intensive care units transfuse only O group blood as routine practice, future trials are needed to investigate the association between this practice and neonatal mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The patient was receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thromboelastometry (ROTEM(®)) on admission revealed low maximum clot firmness (MCF) in the FIBTEM assay, strongly indicating impaired fibrin polymerization. Inhibition of platelet activity also was confirmed. Massive intra-abdominal bleeding caused by a liver rupture required immediate laparotomy. Haemostasis during emergency surgery was achieved through topical surgical measures and intravenous fibrinogen concentrate administration (three doses of 4 g), guided by ROTEM test results only. As platelet count decreased to 28 × 10(9) L(-1), 6 h after admission to the intensive care unit, the patient received two units of platelet concentrate. No further haemostatic therapy was necessary during the next 48 h. CONCLUSION: This case shows the potential effectiveness of fibrinogen concentrate in improving haemostasis in trauma patients receiving antiplatelet therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To evaluate whether or not centrifugal blood pumping during open heart surgery is beneficial, a randomized, prospective study was undertaken of 50 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. The patients were divided into two groups of 25 each. In group 1 a centrifugal pump (Biomedicus) was used as arterial blood pump, while in group 2 a roller pump (Stöckert) was used. The two groups did not differ significantly and the number of variables during surgery was kept low (identical perfusion set, two surgeons, minimal cardiotomy suction). The parameters studied included the cellular elements of the blood and components indicating their functional integrity, such as PMN-elastase, plasma hemoglobin, beta-thromboglobulin, and thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer as representatives for activated coagulation and secondary fibrinolysis. Blood and urine samples were taken every 15 min during ECC, on arrival in the intensive care unit, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h thereafter. No difference between the groups was found in regard to bypass time, ECC flow and volume, fluid balance, and clinical outcome. Significant differences in favor of group 1 were found in plasma hemoglobin (P less than 0.05), beta-thromboglobulin (P less than 0.01), D-dimer (P less than 0.05), and platelet counts (P less than 0.5). These differences were clearly ECC-time-dependent and became statistically significant after 90 min bypass. We conclude that roller pumps still can be safely used for standard cardiac procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Sixty percent of these patients (pts) achieve Complete remission (CR). However, an estimated 30-40% of pts relapse (Tara L. Lin & Livio Pagano et al., Expert Review of Hematology, 2021). In addition, based on a large US database study and studies from India, the “7+3” regimen is associated with high rates of induction mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and duration of hospital stay. BCL2 inhibition with venetoclax has been a new paradigm for the treatment of AML. Herein, we present our institutional experience in treating AML in pts younger than 60 years (yrs) old with a combination of venetoclax (ven) and azacytidine (aza). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients aged 18-60 who were newly diagnosed with AML between May 2020 and May 2023, and in this study, we included all pts, who met the WHO criteria for AML, did not have APML, had no prior history of treatment for other malignancies, and had not received prior induction treatment. Pts received aza 75 mg/m2 on days 1-7 and ven, which escalated from 100 to 200 to 400 mg on days 1-3. Ven continued at 400 mg without posaconazole or 100 mg with posaconazole from days 4-28, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed after day 28. Patients who achieved morphological remission without count recovery had up to 14 days off therapy before subsequent cycles. Non-responders received up to 1-2 additional cycles. Post-response (defined as a complete remission [CR] ), and patients with measurable residual disease (MRD) negative by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) with the residual blast cutoff being < 0.1% proceeded to further cycles. The primary objective of the study is to focus on the induction mortality rate and complete remission in younger, newly diagnosed AML pts who received aza and ven in the induction period. Responses to induction and subsequent post-remission therapy were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients with AML aged ≥ 18 years and ≤60 years were treated with a combination of aza and ven from May 2020 to May 2023. The median patient age was 47 yrs (interquartile range [IQR]: 30-56 yrs, 52.9% age <50 yrs ), and 52.9% of the pts were males. According to the European Leukemia Network (ELN) guidelines for 2022, using FISH and next-generation sequencing (NGS), 5 out of 17 pts (41.2%) were categorized as having favorable risk, 3 out of 17 patients (17.6%) were categorized as having intermediate risk, and 9 out of 17 pts (41.2%) were categorized as having adverse risk. During their inpatient stay, none of the pts required renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 1 out of 17 (5.8%) pts required mechanical ventilation. The dose of ven was 400 mg in 8 out of 17 patients (47%). One pt was on sertraline and received 200mg of ven. The remaining pts (8/17) received 100 mg of ven with posaconazole, which reduced the cost of the treatment to 50%. The median pretreatment white cell count (WCC) was 11.49 x 10^9/L (IQR: 6.25 to 39.74 x 10^9/L). The platelet count took a median of 31 days to recover above 50 x 10^9/L (IQR: 28-43 days), while the median time for the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to recover above 1 x 10^9/L was 52 days (IQR: 47-60 days). 11 out of 17 (64%) of our patients achieved complete remission (CR1) after the first cycle. Additionally, 5 out of 17 (29.4%) were MRD-negative when compared to a large US study database and an Indian study (see table1). The median duration of hospital stay was 16 days (IQR: 10-20 days), and the induction mortality rate was 1/17 (5.8%) (see table1). This death occurred in a patient with adverse risk. CONCLUSIONS: The response to induction therapy with venetoclax and azacytidine in young adults with AML was similar to the standard “7+3” induction therapy, with around 64% of pts achieving CR after the first cycle. The median duration of hospital stay, frequency of ICU admission, and especially induction mortality have been lower than the “7+3” regimen. BCL2 inhibition has indeed resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of AML. Therefore, it may be the right time to consider the combination of ven and aza as the standard first-line induction therapy for all pts with AML.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DHTR can resemble a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC),1 and MOFS can evolve from either disease process1,3. We describe an unusual presentation of rapidly evolving multiorgan failure in the setting of DHTR with limited therapeutic options due to alloimmunization. Case Presentation: A 39-year-old male with a history of mild sickle cell disease presented to our facility with fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain, and oliguria. Two weeks prior, he was admitted to an outside facility for a VOC, just his second in over two decades, following a spider bite. He required transfusion before being discharged in stable condition. Following discharge, the patient reported having progressive worsening of his symptoms. Though hemodynamically stable on admission, physical exam revealed scleral icterus, jaundice, and oozing from his oral mucosa. The patient's initial work-up was notable for anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, metabolic acidosis with acute renal failure, a normal fibrinogen, and a significant coagulopathy. He had a weakly weakly positive DAT for IgG and C3D though outside records revealed a negative antibody screen prior to his transfusion. The blood bank reported reactivity against all donors, signifying that he had an alloantibody to an antigen ubiquitous to the pool. Final/Working Diagnosis With his history of transfusion two weeks prior, positive DAT, elevated LDH, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the patient's clinical picture was most consistent with DHTR with subsequent hyperhemolysis. Management/Outcome/and or Follow-up The patient was initiated high-dose steroids and IVIG. Despite this, he deteriorated with worsening renal failure and, atypical in DHTR, fulminant liver failure with hyperammonemia and coagulopathy. Within twelve hours, he was encephalopathic with hemodynamic instability, prompting transfer to the ICU where the team considered transfusing the most compatible unit available. However, understanding the risk of further hemolysis, transfusion was held. Hematology tried to obtain sutimlimab but were unable to procure it in time.

Methods: The clinical files of 220 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (those who stayed for one day or less) and group 2 (those who stayed for more than one day). In addition, the reason for hospitalization for five days or more was investigated. The effect of patient variables on the length of stay in the intensive care unit was investigated by logistic regression analysis. Results: Hemoglobin values, ejection fraction values, and intensive care unit hospitalizations were significantly lower (p<0.05) than those in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations of <24 h. The sodium value was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations >24 h than in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations <24 h. The pacemaker requirement rate in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations >24 h was significantly (p<0.05) higher than the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations < 24 h. The sinus rhythm in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations >24 h was significantly lower (p<0.05) than that in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations <24 h. Intensive care transfusion of erythrocyte suspension, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet suspension were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations >24 h than in the group with intensive care unit hospitalizations <24 h. Conclusion: In our study; We found that factors such as preoperative low ejection fraction (EF), hypernatremia, female gender, inotrope requirement, delirium, extubation time, intraoperative-postoperative transfusion, drainage revision affect the length of stay in the intensive care unit In the intraoperative period, methods to protect myocardial and kidney functions and provide hemostasis bleeding control reduce the duration of intensive care hospitalization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Low phosphate (0.3-1.0 mmol/L) was not associated with increased likelihood of requiring ventilation. Platelet count was significantly lower in the low phosphate group (p=0.008).CONCLUSION: In our study, mild and moderate hypophosphataemia was not associated with adverse clinical outcome across most organ systems analysed. Given the current evidence and results of this study, we would suggest that there is a trend towards over-replacement of phosphate, representing a potential clinical safety issue as well as clear financial implications.BACKGROUND: Severe hypophosphataemia in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting has been widely associated with adverse clinical outcomes across multiple organ systems, as well as increased mortality. However, the clinical significance of mild or moderate hypophosphataemia remains uncertain. This can lead to heterogeneous phosphate replacement protocols across different institutions. The aim of this study was to assess the significance of mild and moderate hypophosphataemia on clinical outcomes across several organ systems.METHOD: All patients over a 3-week period in our ICU were retrospectively analysed with admission serum phosphate compared with subsequent clinical outcomes after admission. Low serum phosphate (0.3-1.0 mmol/L), according to local protocol, was compared with normal serum phosphate (>1.0 mmol/L).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To assess the cystatin C (CysC) prognostic value for probability of death in patients with severe and extremely severe pneumonia associated with COVID-19. Material and methods. A single-center prospective study included 72 patients with severe and extremely severe pneumonia associated with COVID-19 undergoing treatment in the ICU of multifunctional medical center from September 2020 to October 2021. Recovered survivors (N=55) were analyzed as a Group 1, non-survivors (N=17) were considered as a Group 2. Results. The serum (s-CysC) and urine (u-CysC) CysC concentrations were significantly lower in Group 1 patients vs Group 2, averaging 1.31 mg/l vs 1.695 mg/l (P=0.013550), and 0.25 mg/l vs 0.94 mg/l (P=0.026308), respectively. Significant differences were also revealed in the subgroups differed by age (P=0.0094), platelet count (P=0.001), serum fibrinogen concentration (P=0.016), as well as CURB (P=0.02334), CRB-65 (P=0.032564), and SOFA (P=0.042042) scores. Therefore, s-CysC and u-CysC were statistically significant predictors of death in patients with pneumonia associated with severe and extremely severe COVID-19: 16.273 (95% CI: 2.503–105,814), P=0.003 and 1.281 (95% CI: 1.011–1.622), P=0.040, respectively. Urine and serum CysC were established as predictors of death in pneumonia associated with severe and extremely severe COVID-19, where u-CysC was defined as highly informative (ROC AUC 0.938 (95% CI: 0.867–1.000; P=0.000), with 90% sensitivity and specificity), and s-CysC — as informative (ROC AUC 0.863 (95%CI: 0.738–0.988; P=0.000) with 80% sensitivity and 72% specificity) predictive markers. Conclusion. Levels of S-CysC and u-CysC are of high prognostic significance and may contribute to identi-fying patients at a high risk of unfavorable outcome (death) due to pneumonia associated with severe and extremely severe COVID-19. Both S-CysC and u-CysC concentrations increasing up to ≥1.44 mg/l and ≥0.86 mg/l, respectively, were associated with high probability of death.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The incidence of stage IV disease decreased by 50 per cent over the course of the study (P < 0.001). Lymph node involvement declined by 30 per cent (P < 0.01). Endoscopy displaced contrast radiography as the primary diagnostic modality. Sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy averaged 92 per cent. Twice as many patients were resected for cure in the current decade compared with the 1970s (P < 0.001). Operative mortality was less than 2.5 per cent for the entire period studied and has been nil in the 1990s. Intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements also decreased significantly each decade. Hospital stay was shortened by 41 per cent and the length of postoperative stay in the intensive care unit decreased from a median of 4 days to zero. Five-year survival improved significantly during the study period, mirrored by an increase in survival for early cancers. We have found an earlier presentation of gastric adenocarcinoma over the past 3 decades that parallels an increased use of endoscopy and an improved sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy. More patients are now resectable than in previous decades. Survival after surgical treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma improved between 1970 and 1996, partially due to an increase in earlier stage lesions. Improved survival is also demonstrable when only early stage cancers are considered.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Saunders,,"Introduction. Excessive bleeding is considered to be a common complication during and after the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. As antifibrinolytic drugs have been shown to reduce the bleeding tendency and transfusion requirements in cardiac surgery, they are a standard part of the therapeutic protocol for the Norwood procedure. Owing to safety concerns, aprotinin has been replaced by tranexamic acid in our centre. The aim of the study was to compare efficacy of these two antifibrinolytic strategies. Method. Thirty-one newborns who underwent the Norwood procedure from January 2005 to December 2010 were included in the retrospective study. They were divided into 2 groups: group I (n=18) receiving aprotinin and group II (n=13) receiving tranexamic acid. Results. There was no difference in terms of blood loss or amount of red blood cells, whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, fibrinogen, and platelet concentrate transfused. Duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, the length of stay at the intensive care unit, and mortality were not different. Discussion. The Norwood procedure as the first palliative stage for hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires cardiopulmonary bypass, cross-clamping and hypothermic circulatory arrest. These factors in line with neonatal haematologic immaturity and clotting factor deficiency [1] cause excessive bleeding during and after surgery.

However, its prognostic impact has not been fully addressed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the change in the platelet number during IABP use on the prognosis after device removal. This is a retrospective observational study. Patients in the intensive cardiac care unit at three Juntendo University hospitals who underwent percutaneous implantation of IABP with or without veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO), since 2012-2016, were enrolled in the study (n = 439). Patients who died during mechanical circulatory support (n = 47) were excluded. We evaluated the prognostic impact of the ratio of platelet reduction from the baseline (% PLT reduction) during IABP use on cardiovascular mortality after device removal. The median and the range of follow-up period were 298 days and 0-1,869 days, respectively. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with a higher % PLT reduction had higher cardiovascular (CV) mortality. An adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that a 10% higher % PLT reduction was associated with higher cardiovascular (CV) mortality (Hazard ratio: 1.3, 95% Confidence interval: 1.1-1.6, P < 0.001). Moreover, % PLT reduction and the maximum C-reactive protein (CRP) level during IABP use were positively correlated (r = 0.326, P < 0.001). The reduced number of platelets during IABP use was associated with an increased risk of CV mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The principal modifications observed, often correlated were raised blood and plasma viscosity, reduction in the aggregation index, and diminution in filterability. It should be noted that the increase in viscosity, constant in all groups, is significant at low shearing speeds in the thrombosis cases, and that this significance is present in nearly all the pathological groups with high shearing speeds.

METHODS: Non diabetic 36 patients were enrolled. Blood cardioplegia was used at all cases; insulin and glucose were added at the study group. Blood samples were taken from the coronary sinus and the radial artery before cross-clamp (T1), at 1st (T2) and 30th(T3) minutes after reperfusion. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecules-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular adhesion molecules-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble platelet/endothelial cells adhesion marker-1 (sPECAM-1) and serum lactate levels were measured in these samples. Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, troponin, and myoglobin) were measured at postoperative 1th, 8th and 16th hours. The total duration of mechanical ventilatory support during postoperative period, and the number of days in the intensive care unit and hospital were recorded. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in sVCAM-1 levels in blood taken from the radial artery at T1, T2 and T3 in either group. There were significant increases between T1 and T3 and between T2 and T3 in samples obtained form the coronary sinus (P=0.000 and P=0.003, respectively). Significant increases in sPECAM-1 in samples obtained from both sites between T2 and T3 in both groups (P=0.000) were observed. These differences were similar in both groups. Troponin levels at 8th and 16th hours in the blood-insulin cardioplegia group were higher than the blood cardioplegia group (P=0.003 and P=0.032, respectively). CONCLUSION: Supplementation of blood cardioplegia with insulin did not yield a significant improvement in adhesion molecules. Therefore, superiority of one cardioplegia over the other in delivering myocardial protection during open-heart surgery has not been shown.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The contribution of platelet activity and endothelial dysfunction to trauma-induced coagulopathy remain to be defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time courses of soluble P-selectin (sPsel, an index of platelet activation) and von Willebrand factor (VWF, an index of endothelial dysfunction) in trauma patients and elucidate their relationship to coagulation parameter levels, the presence of coagulopathy, and patient outcome. This prospective observational study, which took place in a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU), included 82 severely injured trauma patients. The sPsel, VWF antigen, protein C, and factor VII levels were measured and routine coagulation tests were performed upon admission to ICU and daily within the first week. The 30-day mortality rate was also determined. Thirty-seven (45.1%) patients developed coagulopathy upon admission to the ICU, and the 30-day mortality rate was 20.7% (n = 17). Both the admission sPsel and VWF levels were lower in patients with coagulopathy than in those without (p < 0.05) and were significantly correlated with the protein C and factor VII levels, respectively (all p < 0.05). The VWF levels were lower during the first 3 days and higher on day 7 after admission in nonsurvivors than in survivors (all p < 0.05). No significant differences in sPsel levels were found between nonsurvivors and survivors on each day during the first week. In severely injured trauma patients in the ICU, lower levels of sPsel and VWF on admission were associated with the presence of coagulopathy and might not predict a better outcome. An increase in the VWF level at the end of the first week after admission to ICU was associated with increased 30-day mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Aims: This pilot study compared equivalent VHA parameters using TEG 6s and Rotem Sigma in patients with major bleeding undergoing non‐cardiac and nontransplant surgery. Methods: In early 2018 VHA device validation was undertaken on 15 patients. 30 bleeding patients were randomly recruited by anaesthetic staff from May to December 2018. Citrated viscoelastic haemostatic assays were run on the same citrated blood samples. Data for time to test, time to transfuse, product transfusion, parameters for equivalent assays ie CFF ‐ Fibtem, CRT ‐ Extem, CK ‐ Intem and anaesthetic team feedback was collected. R Coefficient for VHA parameters was derived as per R Core Team (2018). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R‐project. org/. Results: Results showed a strong correlation for CFF and Fibtem A10 all results, CFF ‐ Fibtem A10 with normal values and Maximum Amplitude and Clot Formation Time in CRT ‐ Extem and CK ‐ Intem. There was weaker correlation between abnormal CFF ‐ Fibtem A10 results, as well as R time and Clotting Time in the CRT ‐ Extem and CK ‐ Intem assays across all values. Summary/Conclusions: Despite consistency, the different CFF‐Fibtem results when abnormal triggered different fibrinogen dosing as per our TEG 6s and Rotem algorithms. Further investigation with a larger, bleeding, patient cohort is recommended for data acquisition and investigation of potential savings in both product usage and cost.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients and Methods: This study was designed as a retrospective review in the intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital. One-hundred forty-one consecutive patients with hypoxic (n = 135) or hypercarbic (n = 6) respiratory failure referred for consideration of ECLS between 1990 and 1996. Overall, initial Pao2/Fio2 (P/F) ratio was 75 ± 5 (median = 66). Results: Lung recovery occurred in 67% of patients and 62% survived. Forty-one patients improved without ECLS (83% survived); 100 did not and were supported with ECLS (54% survived). Survival was greater in patients cannulated within 12 hours of arrival (59%) compared with those cannulated after 12 hours (40%, P < .05). Multiple logistic regression identified age, duration of mechanical ventilation before transfer, four or more dysfunctional organs, and the requirement for ECLS as independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: An approach that emphasizes lung protection and early implementation of extracorporeal life support is associated with high rates of survival in patients with severe respiratory failure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To evaluate the effect of priming solutions on haemodynamics and colloid osmotic pressure, we studied 36 patients elected for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). They were randomly assigned to 2.5% hydroxyethyl starch, 3% gelatin or 4% human albumin priming solution. Total blood loss (perioperative + intensive care unit period) was higher in the gelatin group than in the albumin and hydroxyethyl starch groups. During CPB, the colloid osmotic pressure was best preserved in the gelatin group, although no excessively low colloid osmotic pressures were measured in the other two groups. Due to the extended half-life and the additional postoperative colloid administration, the hydroxyethyl starch group had a higher colloid osmotic pressure in the postoperative phase. We conclude that, next to human albumin, 2.5% hydroxyethyl starch is a safe CPB priming solution additive and is effective as plasma substitute. Its somewhat longer half-life requires adaptation of the routine protocol for transfusion of colloids and blood products.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Women were included if they delivered between 23w0d to 28w6d and the neonate was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. A composite maternal morbidity (blood transfusion, infection, placental abruption, postpartum depression diagnosed or screen positive) was compared for women who delivered between 23w0d to 25w6d (early) and 26w0d to 28w6d (late). T-test, Mann Whitney U or Fisher’s exact test were used where appropriate. Results: During the study period, 82 women met the inclusion criteria. There were 38 women in the early group compared to 44 women in the late group. Maternal age, BMI, delivery type (vaginal vs cesarean), hypertensive disease, membrane status, smoking, drug use and multifetal gestations were similar between the groups. The early delivery group was significantly more likely to experience composite maternal morbidity (60.5% vs 29.5%, p=0.0072). The early group was also more likely to experience maternal infection (42.1% vs 15.9%, p=0.0131). Conclusion: While it is well-established that neonatal morbidity and mortality are increased with decreasing gestational age, our data suggest that maternal morbidity is higher with delivery at early gestational ages. Composite morbidity and maternal infection appear to be a particularly frequent complication in those delivering less than 26 weeks. Because maternal morbidity is an increasing burden with a national focus on reduction, the management of women at risk for imminent delivery at early gestational ages should include a discussion of increased maternal complications.

Transfusing matched RBC units may offer prophylaxis against alloimmunization, although the cost-effectiveness of this approach is controversial, and antigen negative RBCs are a limited resource. In order to help inform the need for prophylaxis against alloimmunization, here we present the economic and clinical burden of RBC alloimmunization in a broad patient population. Study Design/Methods: A cross-sectional study using the Premier Hospital chargemaster dataset (1/2015- 6/2019) was performed. Alloimmunization was defined as the presence of antiglobulin crossmatch and RBC antibody identification codes in a patient record, an approach that was validated previously. Matching of cases and controls was based on: sex, age, admission date and visit type (outpatient vs. inpatient). All patient diagnoses were included. Hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, inpatient mortality, and total cost per discharge were calculated. Bivariate comparisons were performed, assuming a two-tailed test of significance and an α; level of 0.05. Multivariable regression models adjusting for diagnosisrelated groups with an incidence ≥1% were performed. Results/Findings: Overall, 599,281 alloimmunized discharges (cases) were matched to 599,281 non-alloimmunized (controls). Demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced. Mean (SD) age was 52.2 (23.3) and 53.0 (23.5) for the case and control groups, respectively; both groups were predominantly female (70.7% and 69.9%). The most common major diagnostic categories for inpatient visits were pregnancy/ childbirth/puerperium (22.3% and 16.9%, for cases and controls, respectively) and musculoskeletal disorders (11.2% and 11.7%). Cases had significant clinical risk factors and higher costs compared to controls: CI: Confidence Interval; ICU: Intensive Care Unit; IRR: Incidence Rate Ratios; LoS: Length of Stay; OR: Odds Ratio. Conclusions: The burden of alloimmunization in the SCD population has been previously established. Herein, we show that alloimmunization leads to higher healthcare costs, worsened clinical outcomes, and increased risk of in-hospital death for all patients. Although further research is required, these findings suggest the importance of RBC alloimmunization preventive strategies.

Saunders,,"Introduction: Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) commonly suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors. Severe CAD requiring coronary artery bypass (CAB) has traditionally been a contraindication to LT, as cardiac surgery in end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is associated with poor outcomes and complications related to ESLD. In this case report, we present a patient who underwent LT successfully following Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) for critical multivessel CAD. Methods: A 62-year-old male with ESLD secondary alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (MELD-Na score 20, Child-Pugh Score C) was listed for LT. Coronary angiogram showed calcified multivessel CAD with severe stenosis in proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), proximal ramus intermedius (RI) and circumflex artery with normal right coronary. Echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function with no valve pathology. A multidisciplinary team discussed the case and coronary revascularization was necessary prior to LT. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of LAD would require multiple long stents with an elevated risk of thrombosis without dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 6 months. Conversely, non-LAD vessels could be treatable with short stents requiring 1 month of DAPT. Therefore, HCR (minimally invasive surgical revascularization of the LAD followed by PCI of the non-LAD vessels) would shorten the time of DAPT to 1 month, thereby reducing the LT waiting period. Results: Standard ASA cardiac surgery monitoring was used. After induction, left lung isolation was performed. Fresh frozen plasma was transfused before surgery started. Mean arterial pressures were maintained > 65 mmHg with low-dose vasopressin infusion. A left anterior small thoracotomy was performed, left internal thoracic artery was anastomosed to LAD without cardiopulmonary bypass. Total blood loss was 500 ml with no transfusion. The patient was extubated one hour after surgery, pain was managed with morphine and an intercostal catheter with ropivacaine 0.2% infusion. Five days after surgery, PCI of the RI with a Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus Eluting Stent was placed and DAPT was prescribed for 1 month. After two months LT was performed, complicated by severe reperfusion syndrome and coagulopathy requiring massive blood transfusion. The patient remained intubated in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with an open abdomen for 24 hours. After 4 days, the patient was extubated and discharged from ICU 3 days later. Following 28 days in rehabilitation, the patient went home. After 8 months, the patient remains well with excellent graft function and no cardiovascular complications. Discussion: Severe CAD is considered a contraindication for LT. Conventional CAB in ESLD patients is associated with a prohibitively high risk of periprocedural mortality. Current advances in minimally invasive techniques of coronary revascularization can alter the trajectory of these patients, enabling their candidacy for LT. Patients, who's CAD cannot be treated with multi-vessel PCI or are not deemed healthy enough to tolerate a long wait period for LT due to prolonged DAPT necessary following complex PCI can benefit from HCR that can offer complete coronary revascularization with short-term DAPT. HCR can certainly broaden the spectrum of treatment options for patients with ESLD and CAD requiring LT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two independent investigators reviewed bleeding reports from 1034 individuals with 1121 major bleeds enrolled in 5 phase III trials comparing dabigatran with warfarin in 27 419 patients treated for 6 to 36 months. Patients with major bleeds on dabigatran (n=627 of 16 755) were older, had lower creatinine clearance, and more frequently used aspirin or non‐steroid anti‐inflammatory agents than those on warfarin (n=407 of 10 002). The 30‐day mortality after the first major bleed tended to be lower in the dabigatran group (9.1%) than in the warfarin group (13.0%; pooled odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.46‐1.01; P=0.057). After adjustment for sex, age, weight, renal function, and concomitant antithrombotic therapy, the pooled odds ratio for 30‐day mortality with dabigatran versus warfarin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.44‐1.00; P=0.051). Major bleeds in dabigatran patients were more frequently treated with blood transfusions (423/696, 61%) than bleeds in warfarin patients (175/425, 42%; P<0.001) but less frequently with plasma (dabigatran, 19.8%; warfarin, 30.2%; P<0.001). Patients who experienced a bleed had shorter stays in the intensive care unit if they had previously received dabigatran (mean 1.6 nights) compared with those who had received warfarin (mean 2.7 nights; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who experienced major bleeding on dabigatran required more red cell transfusions but received less plasma, required a shorter stay in intensive care, and had a trend to lower mortality compared with those who had major bleeding on warfarin.

Understanding the predictive factors of blood product usage in major burns can improve effective transfusion therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the Burn Center, First Affiliated Hospital of the Chinese Naval Military Medical University, from August 2009 to July 2019 and enrolled all patients with major burns treated in that decade. Basic information, condition, and blood-transfusion details of the patients were analyzed to identify predictive factors for blood use and prognosis. Despite a yearly decreasing trend, the frequency of use of blood-product usage in major burns was high at 57.72%, with 5.39 times and 28.76 units of blood usage per person. Burn area was the most important predictive factor for blood transfusion at different stages. Burn depth, combined with injury, age, and other factors, affected blood use. Blood use or volume correlated with prognosis; especially, platelet and cryoprecipitate use was significantly associated with increased mortality. Blood product usage in major burns patients is related not only to the clinical condition, but also to doctors' experience, which can predict prognosis. Blood use is associated with increased mortality, although we found no evidence of a causal association.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We compared the fall in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels after CS, estimated blood loss, the need for additional uterotonic agents, blood transfusion, and the rate of postpartum hemorrhage between women with carbetocin and women with oxytocin treatment, stratified by indications for CS. Results: For women with elective CS, decreased Hb and Hct falls were noted with carbetocin treatment compared to oxytocin treatment in women with indications for prior CS, fetal malpresentation, and multiple gestation. The need for additional uterotonics was less in CS for prior CS, fetal malpresentation, and cephalopelvic disproportion and fewer transfusions in CS for multiple gestation in women with carbetocin compared to women with oxytocin treatment. For women with intrapartum CS, carbetocin was associated with decreased use of additional uterotonic agents and transfusion in CS for dysfunctional labor.

We use data analysis of three registries to evaluate safety issues and sufficiency of different TxA dosages in our center. Methods: Registry 1: Single shot ultra-low dose TxA (1 g in priming volume). Registry 2: Single shot medium dose TxA (5 g in priming volume). Registry 3: Single shot medium dose TxA (3 g in priming volume) and continuous, weight-adapted administration during cross clamping. Independence of surgeon's preference was achieved by changing dosage every surgery day regardless of operation schedule. Results: Data analysis was carried out on 1182 consecutive, elective patients (1 g TxA n = 415; 3 g + x g TA n = 367; mean TxA dose 4.4 g ± 1.0 g; 5 g TxA n = 400). Patient characteristics were well matched in all three registries (mean age: 69 ± 9.5y, BMI 28.2 ± 4.7, Creatinin 107.5 ± 52.8 μM), as were performed surgical procedures (excluding organ transplantation). Postoperative data showed no significant differences for blood loss and major adverse events (1 g vs. 3 + g vs. 5 g: blood loss: 894 ± 1479 vs. 903 ± 1282 vs. 1004 ± 1604 ml; stroke: 1.5 vs. 1.6 vs. 1.5%; myocardial infarction 2.7 vs. 3.3 vs. 1.3%; 30d mortality 3.9 vs. 4.2 vs. 4.8%, respectively). Secondary endpoints (de novo dialysis, transfusion requirement, ICU and total treatment time) showed no significant differences between registries. Conclusion: Use of 1 g TxA is safe and sufficient for elective patients with on pump cardiac surgery and thus has been established as strategy of choice in our center. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

In contrast to cell-free hemoglobin, encapsulation prevents hemoglobin extravasation, whereas its subcellular size (230 nm) may improve O2 delivery and limit the severity of cerebral infarction. METHODS - The extent of cerebral infarction was determined 24 hours after photochemically induced thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery from the integrated area of infarction detected by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining in rats receiving no treatment, 10 mL/kg of LEH, homologous blood, empty liposomes, or saline. To develop a dose-response relationship, LEH dose was reduced from 10 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg, 0.4 mL/kg, and 0.08 mL/kg. RESULTS - Infarction extent was significantly suppressed in rats receiving LEH as compared with animals receiving no infusion, saline, empty liposome, or transfusion in the cortex but not in the basal ganglia, where all had similar degrees of damage. The dose-response relationship revealed that as little as 2 mL/kg of LEH was protective, whereas the total blood O2 content, hemoglobin level, and transfusion and/or infusion of empty liposomes or saline were not effective. CONCLUSIONS - Our results suggest that LEH significantly reduces the area of infarction in the cortex but not in basal ganglia after photochemically induced thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery in the rat. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Acute treatments necessitate rapid hemorrhage control to minimize secondary brain injury. Here, we discuss the overlap of transfusion medicine and acute ICH care relating to diagnostic testing and therapies relevant for coagulopathy reversal and secondary brain injury prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: Hematoma expansion (HE) is the largest contributor to poor outcomes after ICH. Conventional coagulation assays to diagnose coagulopathy after ICH does not predict HE. Given the testing limitations, empiric pragmatic hemorrhage control therapies have been trialed but have not improved ICH outcomes, with some therapies even causing harm. It is still unknown whether faster administration of these therapies will improve outcomes. Alternative coagulation tests (e.g., viscoelastic hemostatic assays, amongst others) may identify coagulopathies relevant for HE, currently not diagnosed using conventional assays. This provides opportunities for rapid, targeted therapies. In parallel, ongoing work is investigating alternative treatments using transfusion-based or transfusion-sparing pharmacotherapies that can be implemented in hemorrhage control strategies after ICH. SUMMARY: Further work is needed to identify improved laboratory diagnostic approaches and transfusion medicine treatment strategies to prevent HE and optimize hemorrhage control in ICH patients, who appear particularly vulnerable to the impacts of transfusion medicine practices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IHD and CRRT for AKI have not shown an indisputable benefit of one technique over the other. However, these studies were conducted more than 15 years ago. Major progresses were eventually made leading to much lower mortality rates in recent studies of RRT for AKI. In addition, an important pitfall of previous studies on RRT modalities is that the indications for initiating RRT were disputable in the light of present knowledge. Indeed, these studies included a noticeable proportion of patients who could have recovered without ever receiving RRT. Three recent RCTs on the timing of RRT for AKI have shown that, in the absence of immediate life‐threatening complication, RRT initiation can be safely delayed, allowing up to 49% of severe AKI patients to escape RRT. Many such patients who did not actually require RRT were included in previous studies on modalities. This justifies a reevaluation of this issue by the performance of a new RCT that takes recent knowledge on RRT initiation into account. The main objective is to evaluate whether IHD is not inferior to CRRT with regard to overall incidence of a composite outcome of death, persistent renal dysfunction and dialysis dependency at day 90 in critically ill patients with severe AKI. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients who will meet one or more criteria for a major adverse kidney event 90 days after randomization (MAKE90). The MAKE will be the composite of death, renal replacement therapy dependence and/or an increase in serum creatinine above 25% of its basal value. The secondary objectives will address the effect of IHD versus CRRT on: 1. Survival (at different time points: D28, D60, D90) 2. Persistence of renal dysfunction (at different time points: D28, D60, D90) 3. Dialysis dependency (at different time points: D28, D60, D90) 4. ICU and hospital length of stay 5. Duration of RRT 6. Number of organ failure‐free days (catecholamine‐free days, ventilator‐free days, RRT‐free days) at day 28 7. Estimated renal function at hospital discharge 8. Occurrence of adverse events (hypotension, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycaemia, hypophosphataemia, hypothermia, cardiac rhythm disorders, air embolism, bloodstream infection) 9. Medico‐economic aspects Another secondary objective will be to assess the ability of plasma and urinary AKI biomarkers collected at D0 an ICU discharge to predict renal function recovery. The secondary endpoints will be: 1. Time to death; day‐28; day‐60 and day‐90 mortality 2. Number of patients with more than a 25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline at different time points: D28, D60, D90 3. Number of patients with dialysis dependency at different time points: D28, D60, D90 4. ICU and hospital length of stay 5. Time until cessation of RRT 6. Catecholamine‐free days, ventilator‐free days and RRT free days through day 28. 7. Estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate at hospital discharge 8. The number of episodes of adverse events from inclusion until day 28 (or ICU discharge): ‐ Hypotension: systolic arterial pressure < 80 mmHg or a fall > 50 mmHg from baseline value ‐ Hemorrhage requiring red blood cell transfusion or surgical procedure ‐ Thrombocytopenia < 100 000 platelets/mm3 ‐ Hypoglycaemia: blood glucose concentrations<3.0 mmol/L ‐ Hypophosphataemia: serum phosphate concentration<0.6 mmol/l ‐ Hypothermia: core body temperature <34°C ‐ Cardiac rhythm disorders: ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes or new episode of atrial fibrillation requiring medical treatment or external electric counter shock ‐ Air embolism ‐ Catheter‐related (or unknown origin) bloodstream infection 9. Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio in € per MAKE‐90 averted Another secondary endpoint will be the association between the concentration of several plasma and urinary AKI biomarkers (KIM‐1, CCL‐14, PENKID, NGAL) collected at D0 and at ICU discharge and the MAKE‐90. This is a non‐inferiority multicenter open‐label randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. Randomization will take place 1:1 to 2 groups: a group receiving IHD and a group receiving CRRT. Randomization will be stratified according to center, dose of vasopressor and cumulative fluid balance from ICU admission. Treatment will be initiated and monitored by the physician responsible for patient. Whatever the group, investigators will follow recommendations to achieve optimal metabolic control and hemodynamic stability. IHD group: a central venous access, a biocompatible membrane and bicarbonate dialysate will be used. In accordance with the management recommendations, the investigators will plan at least 3 sessions of 4 to 6 hours per week each with blood flow > 200ml/min, dialysate flow>500ml/min, high sodium concentration (>145 mmol/L) and low temperature (35°C) in the dialysate. The investigators will recommend urea reduction ratio > 65% for each session. CRRT group: a central venous access and a biocompatible membrane will be used. The investigators will plan continuous treatment with a change of membrane every 72 hours (unless clotting occurs before). Choice between continuous veno‐venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration (CVVHF), or continuous veno‐venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) will be left at physician discretion. The investigators will recommend a minimum delivered dose of dialysis of 20‐25 ml/Kg/h of effluent by filtration and/or diffusion. For both groups, anticoagulation will be implemented according to center practice (regional citrate will be strongly recommended for CVVHDF). The randomly assigned treatment modality will be unchanged for at least 4 consecutive days unless renal recovery occurs before and mandates RRT discontinuation. A shift for the other modality will be allowed after this delay according to clinician decision. Discontinuation of RRT will be contemplated when spontaneous diuresis is >500 ml/24h, and highly recommended if diuresis >1000 ml/24h without diuretic or >2000 ml/24h in patients receiving diuretics, as in our previous studies (AKIKI and AKIKI2). Vital status, need for dialysis and serum creatinine will be collected at day 28, day 60 and day 90. Patients or their surrogates or the general practitioner (GP) will be contacted by phone. Prescriptions for plasma creatinine measurements (at D60 and D90) will be provided to the patient at discharge from the hospital. Inclusion criteria 1. Adults (> or= 18 years old) in ICU 2. Receiving (or who have received) invasive mechanical ventilation and/or catecholamine infusion 3. Availability of both equipment IHD and CRRT (in the investigational center at the time of inclusion) 4. One of the 2 following situations 4.a: Either at least one of the 3 following complications of AKI (whatever the KDIGO stage): persistent severe hyperkalaemia despite medical treatment, persistent severe metabolic acidosis despite medical treatment or severe pulmonary edema due to fluid overload despite diuretic therapy 4.b: Or an AKI stage 3 of KDIGO with one of the 2 following criteria: serum urea concentration>40mmol/L or persistence of oligo‐anuria>3 days 5. Affiliation of social security system 6. Written consent obtained from the patients (from a support person, family member or a close relative if the patient is not able to expressing and sign consent) or inclusion without initial consent in case of emergency, if the patient is not able to express his/her consent and in the absence of support person, family member or a close relative Non‐inclusion criteria ‐ Moribund state (patient likely to die within 24h) ‐ Previous inclusion in the study ‐ Subject deprived of freedom, or under a legal protective measure (example: patients under guardianship or curatorship) ‐ Subject receiving state medical aid ‐ Pregnancy or breastfeeding woman ‐ Patient included in another research trial on AKI ‐ Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined by an estimated GFR<20 mL/min/1.73 m2 ‐ Presence of a drug overdose or of a dialyzable toxin that necessitates RRT (because IHD may be preferable in these conditions).• Presence or clinical suspicion of renal obstruction, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy or acute interstitial nephritis ‐ Brain injured patients or other causes of increased intracranial pressure ‐ Fulminant hepatic failure The investigators plan to include 1000 participants. Adjusted difference between the proportions of the two arms, of patients who will meet one or more criteria for a major adverse kidney event at day 90 (MAKE90), will be estimated with 95% two‐sided confidence interval (95% CI) by the Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel method, stratified by fluid overload and vasopressor dose. If the upper limit of the 95% CI is < 7.5%,the investigators will conclude the IHD is not inferior to CRRT. If the 95% confidence interval does not only lie entirely below 7.5% but also adjusted difference is less than zero, a superiority test will be carried out using the same method. A subgroup analysis will be done according to fluid overload (≥ 6 liters from admission ICU to randomization) and to vasopressor dose (> 0.5 mcg/kg/min). Medico‐economic analysis: The cost estimation will be expressed with mean and 95% confidence intervals obtained by the bootstrapping method. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio is defined as the ratio of the difference between mean costs and the difference on the primary endpoint. It will also be estimated by a mean and the 95% confidence interval using bootstrap method.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, the detailed association of thrombocytopenia with subsequent progression of organ functions and long-term prognosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains to be explored. METHODS: Medical records of 167 confirmed cases of critically ill COVID-19 from February 16 to March 21, 2020 were collected in this two-center retrospective study. 180-day's outcome and clinical organ development in patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia were analyzed. FINDINGS: Among all 167 patients, the median age was 66 years and 67.07% were male. Significant differences were noticed in laboratory findings including white blood cells, blood urea, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and SOFA score between groups of thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. Older age, lower platelet count and longer activated partial thromboplastin time at admission were determined to be risk factors of 28-day mortality, and all three, together with higher white blood cells were risk factors of 180-day mortality. Subsequent changes of six-point ordinal scale score, oxygenation index, and SOFA score in patients with thrombocytopenia showed marked worsening trends compared with patients without thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had significantly higher mortality not only in 28 days, but also in 90 days and 180 days. The time-course curves in non-survival group showed a downtrend of platelet count and oxygenation index, while the curve of six-point ordinal scale kept an uptrend. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with thrombocytopenia had much lower probability of survival (p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: The thrombocytopenia was associated with the deterioration of respiratory function. Baseline platelet count was associated with subsequent and long-term mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: A cohort study from a prospectively collected database was conducted, including consecutive patients undergoing surgery in a high-volume colorectal surgery department in 2009. RESULTS: For 1,461 included patients, average expected and actual LOS were 8.17 days (interquartile range, 4.7 to 11.9 days) and 8.31 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10 days), respectively. The most prominent factors associated with an increase of LOS from expected were parenteral nutrition (5.11 days), emergency room admittance (3.67 days), and ileus (3.45 days) (P ≤ .001 for all). Other independently associated factors included blood transfusion, anastomotic leak, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and surgeon. Patients with higher severity illness indexes and longer postoperative intensive care stay had lower than expected LOS. CONCLUSIONS: After colorectal surgery, several modifiable factors are associated with deviation of LOS from expected. An opportunity hence exists to reduce both LOS and financial burden for hospitals in an era of pay for performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients with severe cases present with extreme leukocytosis and develop refractory hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension that is unresponsive to maximal intensive care. This may reflect a hyperviscosity syndrome from the raised white blood cell (WBC) count. Case reports suggest improved outcomes with exchange transfusion to reduce the WBC count. Our objective was to quantify possible benefits of aggressive leukodepletion. METHODS: We, as a regional PICU and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation referral center, adopted a strategy of aggressive leukodepletion in January 2005. The impact of this strategy on crude and case mix-adjusted survival of all infants who were critically ill with B pertussis were compared with control subjects from January 2001 to December 2004 and Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation registry data. RESULTS: Nineteen infants (7 [37%] boys) received intensive care for B pertussis from 2001 to 2009. Admission WBC counts were equivalent in 2 time periods: 2001-2004 (mean: 52,000/μL) and 2005-2009 (mean: 75,000/μL). In 2001-2004, 5 (55%) of 9 patients survived the ICU. Between 2005 and 2009, 9 (90%) of 10 patients survived. When case-mix adjustment for age, WBC count, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation referral were considered, the 2001-2004 predicted survival (4.4 [49%] of 9.0) was equivalent to the observed mortality (4.0 [44%] of 9.0).

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, interventional crossover study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 16 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, who were diagnosed as having severe sepsis by defined criteria and who had a hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received, in random order, an infusion of dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) and a blood transfusion (800 mL of packed red blood cells in 90 mins). Hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables were determined before and after each treatment, allowing at least 20 mins during the infusion of dobutamine to achieve the steady state. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changes in DO2 and VO2 induced by each intervention were measured. Dobutamine significantly increased DO2 (48.5 +/- 6.9%; p = .0001) and VO2 (21.7 +/- 3.3%; p = .0001). Blood transfusion increased DO2 (21.4 +/- 4.3%; p = .005) but VO2 did not change significantly (2.2 +/- 4.1%). Correlation coefficients for the percent changes of DO2 and VO2 (r2 = .67, p = .001 for dobutamine; and r2 = 21, p = .07 for blood transfusion) were significantly different for each treatment (p = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an abnormal DO2-dependent VO2, as shown by increases in VO2 brought about by an infusion of dobutamine, blood transfusion does not significantly increase VO2, despite significant changes in DO2. The VO2, in some critically ill patients, depends more on blood flow than on global DO2.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The treatment of HIT requires the use of alternative anticoagulants to heparin such as direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs). This is a case report of one patient affected with multiple myeloma (MM) and severe renal impairment with onset of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb complicating HIT during haemodialysis (HD). Case report: A 82 year old woman was admitted to Nephrology Department because of acute worsening of renal function (creatininemia 1.5 mg/dl at baseline; 8.5 mg/dl at admission), the patient underwent daily haemodialysis and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered in the extracorporeal circuit. MM was diagnosed by serum-proteins electrophoresis and bone marrow biopsy, and ten days after admission the patient started chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone). The fourteenth day from admission platelet's count dropped from a baseline (Figure presented) of 104,000 to 37000/μL, initially thought related to chemotherapy. After further six days the patient presented a swollen and painful right leg. A venous compressive ultrasound of lower limbs showed a femoral DVT of the symptomatic side, and PF4-heparin antibodies resulted positive at ELISA test. The patient was transferred to our sub-intensive care unit, were LMWH was stopped and alternative anticoagulant strategy immediately started. Lepirudin (Refludan) was started at an initial dose of 0.01 mg/kg/h (dose adjusted for creatininemia at sub-intensive unit admission) with the aim of maintaining the aPTT ratio between 1.5 and 2.5. Because of severe renal failure, lepirudin monitoring was difficult, and aPTT resulted unsteady and many variations of infusion velocity were needed to reach aPTT target, thus, after 24 hours, lepirudin was replaced with argatroban (Novastan). The starting dose of argatroban was 2 μg/kg/min (corresponding to 9 ml/h) in order to maintain the aPTT ratio between 1.5 and 3.0. The target aPTT ratio was reached after four hours of administration, after the first laboratory assessment, and the infusion went on at 8 ml/h until its stop ten days later. Hemodialysis (days 2, 5, 7,9, from starting DTIs; Fig.1) did not affect the stability of aPTT ratio during argatroban infusion. Five days after starting argatroban, warfarin was added, and five days later, after reaching an INR value of 4.0, argatroban was stopped, and anticoagulation continued with warfarin only. The patient was discharged seven days after. Conclusions: in this case argatroban was effective and safe as alternative anticoagulant in hematologic patient with HIT and thrombosis. The hepatic clearance of this drug allowed to maintain a stable therapeutic aPTT during renal replacement therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

At the present time, there is considerable controversy relating to appropriate management of physiologic variables during CPB. Low-risk patients tolerate mean arterial blood pressures of 50-60 mm Hg without apparent complications, although limited data suggest that higher-risk patients may benefit from mean arterial blood pressures >70 mm Hg. The optimal hematocrit on CPB has not been defined, with large data-based investigations demonstrating that both severe hemodilution and transfusion of packed red blood cells increase the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. Oxygen delivery is determined by the pump flow rate and the arterial oxygen content and organ injury may be prevented during more severe hemodilutional anemia by increasing pump flow rates. Furthermore, the optimal temperature during CPB likely varies with physiologic goals, and recent data suggest that aggressive rewarming practices may contribute to neurologic injury. The design of components of the CPB circuit may also influence tissue perfusion and outcomes. Although there are theoretical advantages to centrifugal blood pumps over roller pumps, it has been difficult to demonstrate that the use of centrifugal pumps improves clinical outcomes. Heparin coating of the CPB circuit may attenuate inflammatory and coagulation pathways, but has not been clearly demonstrated to reduce major morbidity and mortality. Similarly, no distinct clinical benefits have been observed when open venous reservoirs have been compared to closed systems. In conclusion, there are currently limited data upon which to confidently make strong recommendations regarding how to conduct optimal CPB. There is a critical need for randomized trials assessing clinically significant outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients. © 2009 International Anesthesia Research Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods From March 2020 to March 2021, clinical data were retrospectively reviewed for 389 children with acute traumatic brain injury. Coagulation parameters, severity of brain injury and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of all children were collected at admission. And the relationship between changes of coagulation parameters, severity of brain injury and GOS was analyzed by Logistic regression. Results Age, computed tomography (CT) manifestations and treatments methods among children with different degrees of traumatic brain injury were significantly different (Ρ < 0. 05). The differences of prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (APTT), D-dimer (D-D), platelet (PLT) and fibrin degradation product (FDP) in mild, moderate and severe traumatic brain injury were statistically significant (Ρ <0.05). During a follow-up period of 6 months, a significant negative correlation existed between injury severity and GOS (r = 0. 666, Ρ < 0. 05). The values of INR, PLT, PT, FIB, thromboplastin time (TT), D-d and FDP were prolonged in children with acute traumatic brain injury with different prognoses.

We report a case of peripartum cardiomyopathy complicated with intravascular dehydration due to pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). The patient was 25 year old, primiparity, pregnant with dichorionic diamniotic twins. She had uneventful past history. When she visited our hospital for first time at 26 weeks of gestation, her blood pressure was 121/74 mmHg. However, she showed hypertension (143/85 mmHg) at 32 weeks of gestation. Because we found the cervical length was relatively short (22mm) by ultrasonography on the same day, she started taking ritodrine 15mg/day orally under the diagnosis of impending premature birth. At 33 weeks and 4 days, she visited our hospital for dyspnea. She was 159cm in height, 71kg in weight. Her weight was 44kg before pregnancy and presumed to rapidly increase by severe edema of whole body. She showed hypertension (153/91 mmHg), tachycardia (106/min.), and low SpO2 (90% at room air). X ray examination revealed she had cardiac dilatation and pulmonary edema. Urine examination revealed she had albuminuria. Blood examination revealed her platelet count and liver enzyme level were within normal limits. Because we had to conclude that she was in serious condition, we decided to terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section. First infant was male, 2065g in weight, Apgar score 8/9 points (1 minute/ 5 minutes), and pH of umbilical artery was 7.320. Second infant was female, 1805g in weight, Apgar score 9/- points (1 minute/ 5 minutes), and pH was 7.313. After operation, we found that left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was low as 39% by echo cardiography. To monitor cardiac function, Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted and it revealed that pulmonary artery wedge pressure was low as 4 mmHg. From these results, we diagnosed that main reason of pulmonary edema was accentuation of vascular permeability due to acute exacerbation of PIH. Together with the results obtained by biopsy on heart muscle which only showed nonspecific findings, we diagnosed her as peripartum cardiomyopathy complicated with PIH. She was treated in coronary care unit (CCU) for heart failure and discharged at day16 after the operation. When we checked her 6 months later, pulmonary edema had disappeared, however, LVEF was still in low level (45%). After 1 year, her LVEF level recovered to normal range (70%). We need to keep in mind about peripartum cardiomyopathy when we take care of women who show dyspnea during peripartum period.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, concerns about TEA's safety and current equivocal evidence, hinder its widespread usage. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of TEA in cardiac surgery. Methods: We searched four databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the use of TEA against only GA in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, up till 4 June 2022. We conducted random effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird), evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool, and rated certainty of evidence via the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were ICU and Hospital length of stay, with other outcomes including postoperative complications. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted on all outcomes to elicit statistical and clinical benefit. Results: Our meta-analysis included 39 RCTs (1941 TEA patients, 2047 GA patients). TEA significantly reduced ICU LOS (Figure 1: -6.8 hours, 95%-CI: -10.8 to -2.8, p=0.0009), hospital LOS (-0.7 days, 95%-CI: -1.2 to -0.2, p=0.0051), and extubation time (-2.8 hours, 95%-CI: -3.8 to -1.8, p=0.0001). However, there was no significant reduction in mortality. TSA found that the cumulative Z-curve passed the TSA-adjusted boundary for ICU LOS (see below), hospital LOS, and ET, suggesting a clinical benefit. TEA also significantly reduced transfusion requirements, pain scores, delirium, arrhythmia, and pooled pulmonary complications, without additional complications such as epidural hematomas. Conclusions: TEA reduces ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with minimal reported complications. These findings favour the use of TEA in cardiac surgery, and warrants consideration for use in cardiac surgeries worldwide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The current study was performed to determine if liver resection for colorectal metastases is safe and effective and to evaluate predictors of outcome. Materials and Methods: Data for 456 consecutive resections performed between July 1985 and December 1991 in a tertiary referral center were analyzed. Results: The perioperative mortality rate was 2.8%, with a mortality rate of 4.6% for resections that involved a lobectomy or more. The median hospital stay was 12 days and only 9% of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. The 5- year survival rate is 38%, with a median survival duration of 46 months. By univariate analysis, nodal status of the primary lesion, short disease-free interval before detection of liver metastases, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level greater than 200 ng/mL, multiple liver tumors, extrahepatic disease, large tumors, or positive resection margin was predictive of poorer outcome. Sex, age greater than 70 years, site of primary tumor, or perioperative transfusion was not predictive of outcome. By multivariate analysis, positive margin, size greater than 10 cm, disease-free interval less than 12 months, multiple tumors, and extrahepatic disease were independent predictors of poorer outcome. Short disease-free interval or multiple tumors were nevertheless associated with a 5-year survival rate greater than 24%. Conclusion: Liver resection for colorectal metastases is safe and effective therapy and currently represents the only potentially curative therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. The only absolute contraindication to resection is extrahepatic disease. A randomized trial to examine efficacy of surgical resection cannot ethically be performed. Liver resection should be considered standard therapy for all fit patients with colorectal metastases isolated to the liver.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Currently, no pharmacologic treatment strategies exist for this devastating disease. Following the initial mechanical injury suffered at hemorrhage onset, secondary brain injury proceeds through both direct cellular injury and inflammatory cascades, which trigger infiltration of granulocytes and monocytes, activation of microglia, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier with resulting cerebral edema. The complement cascade has been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of secondary injury following ICH, although the specific mechanisms responsible for the proximal activation of complement remain incompletely understood. Cerebral injury following cleavage of complement component 3 (C3) proceeds through parallel but interrelated pathways of anaphylatoxin-mediated inflammation and direct toxicity secondary to membrane attack complex-driven erythrocyte lysis. Complement activation also likely plays an important physiologic role in recovery following ICH. As such, a detailed understanding of the variation in functional effects of complement activation over time is critical to exploiting this target as an exciting translational strategy for intracerebral hemorrhage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Three recent studies have proposed decision trees for patients with tICH to identify those who can be admitted to non-PICU locations but validation is needed before they can be utilized. This study tested the ability of these algorithms to correctly identify pediatric patients with tICH who are at low risk for requiring a critical care intervention (CCI) after admission. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients < 18 years admitted from 3 level 1 trauma centers between Jan 1, 2010 and Sept 1, 2019 who had tICH on initial head CT and did not require a CCI prehospital or in the emergency department. We applied our data to the Children's Intracranial Injury Decision Aid (CHIIDA) scoring system (Greenberg et al.) and to the decision trees proposed by Ament et al. and Burns et al. A CCI was defined as requirement for assisted ventilation, intubation, hyperosmolar therapy, vasoactive medications, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, arrhythmia management, massive blood transfusion, neurosurgical intervention, and/or placement of an intracranial pressure monitor. We assigned CHIIDA scores and tested the two clinical decision trees using our data. RESULTS: 2819 patients with traumatic brain injury were identified within this period. 646 patients with tICH who did not require a preadmission CCI were included in the study and of these, 50 (7.7%) received an inpatient CCI. Patients with a CHIIDA score of 0 had a 2.0% risk of requiring an inpatient CCI compared with 2.6% in Greenberg's study. Using the decision tree by Ament, 4.2% were classified as low risk versus 1.9% in their study while the decision tree by Burns identified 2.0% as low risk compared with 0.6% in their study. Based on the algorithms of Ament and Burns, 18 and 10 patients would have been characterized as low risk, respectively, but actually had an inpatient CCI.

For patients with a negative initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) it is unclear if further inpatient testing affects clinical outcomes. Aims: To evaluate whether additional in-hospital diagnostic testing affect outcomes in patients with UGIB and a negative initial EGD. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients admitted to an academic medical center from April 2016 to April 2017 with melena, hematemesis or coffee ground emesis and who underwent EGD. The cohort was divided between those with diagnos -tic and non-diagnostic EGDs and between those who underwent further inpatient testing or did not. Further testing included repeat EGD, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, capsule endoscopy, enteroscopy, and CT or IR angiogram. In-hospital outcomes included endoscopic intervention, re-bleeding, ICU admission, transfusion requirement, number of red cells transfused, length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. Two-tailed Students T test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare the two groups. Results: One hundred and ninety four patients underwent EGD for symptoms of UGIB, 113 (58%) had source of bleeding identified on initial EGD, and 58 (30%) underwent endoscopic intervention. Patients with a positive EGD had lower initial hemoglobin, higher BUN, higher heart rate, and higher Glasgow Blatchford scores (see Table 1). They were more likely to require ICU stay, red cell and plasma transfusion (P values 0.007, 0.01, 0.05; percent difference 20, 19, 12). Of those with negative initial EGD, 50 (62%) patients underwent additional inpatient testing. A source of bleeding was identified in 17 (34%) patients (11 with colonic source including 3 diverticular bleeds, 4 with small bowel source including 2 AVMs, and 2 gastric ulcers missed on initial EGD). Two patients with small bowel AVMs and 1 with a colonic ulcer underwent endoscopic intervention. There were no significant differences in re-bleeding, ICU stay, red cell transfusion requirement, or mortality whether patients underwent additional inpatient testing or not (P values 0.15, 0.82, 0.07, 1.00; percent difference 17, 4, 21, 2). Conclusion: Among patients with UGIB and non-diagnostic initial EGD further inpatient diagnostic testing did not impact outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We aimed to study the impact of BMI on perioperative outcomes after robotic liver resection. All the patients undergoing robotic liver resection between 2013 and 2017 were prospectively followed. The patients were divided into three groups (BMI < 25, BMI 25–35, BMI > 35 kg/m2) for illustrative purposes. Demographic and perioperative outcome data were compared. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). Thirty-eight patients underwent robotic hepatectomy, 73% were women, age was 58 (57 ± 17.6) years, and ASA class was 3 (3 ± 0.5). Indications for surgery were neoplastic lesions in 34 patients (89%), hemangioma in two patients (6%), fibrous mass in one patient (2.5%), and focal nodular hyperplasia in one patient (2.5%). 32% of the patients underwent right or left hemihepatectomy, 21% underwent sectionectomy, 5% underwent central hepatectomy and the reminder underwent non-anatomical liver resection. Operative time was 261 (254.6 ± 94.3) min. Estimated blood loss was 175 (276 ± 294.8) ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 (5 ± 4.9) days. By regression analysis of the three BMI groups, estimated blood loss, rate of postoperative complication, rate of conversion, need for transfusion, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay did not have a significant relationship with BMI. A total of five patients (13%) experience complications. Four patients had complications that were nonspecific to liver resection, including acute renal injury, respiratory failure, and enterocutaneous fistula. One patient had bile leak, treated with ERCP stenting. No mortality was seen in this study. Obesity should not dissuade surgeons from utilizing minimally invasive robotic approach for liver resection. Robotic technique is a safe and feasible in patients with high BMI. The impact of BMI on outcomes is insignificant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Karger AG, Allschwilerstrasse 10, P.O. Box, CH-4009",,"World wide, heparins are the most commonly used anticoagulants for renal replacement therapy (RRT). In the intensive care unit (ICU) keeping the RRT circuit patent is more difficult than during routine outpatient hemodialysis, as ICU patients typically have sepsis and/or inflammation resulting in activation of the procoagulant pathways, with reduced antithrombin. One important cause of repeated RRT circuit clotting is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which should not be overlooked in patients with a reduced platelet count. If HIT is clinically suspected then all heparins should be withdrawn, and the patient systemically anticoagulated with either a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban and/or hirudin, or the heparinoid danaparoid. The availability and licensing of these alternative anticoagulants varies from country to country. Argatroban has to be continuously infused, which is an advantage for continuous RRT, but not for intermittent RRT, and can be monitored by activated partial thromboplastin time. Hirudin has a prolonged half life, which is extended by hirudin antibodies, and requires specialist monitoring to prevent over anticoagulation. Although the half life of danaparoid is increased in renal failure, it can be given as boluses for intermittent and continuous RRT, or by continuous infusion during continuous RRT, but requires factor Xa monitoring.

The value of viscoelastometry in guiding management of these patients have been well documented. Notably, studies about coagulopathy in burn patients are scarce. Several studies have shown that burn patients are hypercoaguable. However, most of these studies were done using samples collected after patient resuscitations or upon admission to the ICU. Additionally, although burn patients typically have normal to slightly elevated platelets, the platelet function has been questioned in several studies. Study Design/Method: We conducted a prospective observational study of burn patients (≥18 years) presenting to our level 1 trauma center. TEGs were ordered by the burn team on various patients and were not done as part of the study. Citrated samples were collected at patient presentation. Whole blood aggregation studies were performed immediately. The remaining samples were processed immediately and the plasma was kept frozen at-80oC until testing. Additional samples were collected at days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Samples will be studied for microparticle number and identity, microRNA, cytokine/chemokine concentration, and coagulation fac-tor (FVIII, FIX, FX, FV, FVII, PS, PC, von Willebrand factor antigen and activity) values. Results/Finding: To date, 41 patients have been enrolled in this study, which is still ongoing. The majority of patients had thermal burns caused by flame exposure. The mean (±SD) age of patients was 47 ±16 (range 20-87 years) and 70.6% were male. The mean total body surface area burn (TBSA) was 9.7 ±9.5 % (range 0.3-38.3%). The mean number of RBCs transfused was 0.6 (range 0-20 units). No patients received plasma or platelet transfusions and none died. Most TEG tracings were normal or had shortened R times. The mean platelet counts were within our reference range at all time points (Figure 1). Most patients had abnormal whole blood aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid. This was very obvious even in patients with as little as 1% TBSA burn. No patients with abnormal platelet activity were on any platelet inhibitor therapy. Conclusion: The reason for this decreased platelet activity is unclear and further studies are ongoing. One theory is that the platelets may degranulate as a response to the acute phase reaction. This may pro-duce higher percentage of platelet microparticles, which contribute to the hypercoaguable state that has been observed by others and by our TEG studies.

This study aimed to describe a modified prosthesis eversion technique for proximal anastomosis in ascending aorta replacement and compare its operative outcomes with the conventional prosthesis eversion technique. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who had ascending aortic aneurysm and underwent ascending aorta replacement with the modified or conventional prosthesis eversion technique between January 2019 and December 2022 in our center. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included: 55 in the modified group and 53 in the conventional group. The durations of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping and total operation in the conventional group were longer than those in the modified group. Furthermore, perioperative blood loss and the incidence of re-exploration for bleeding were significantly lower in the modified group. Accordingly, patients in the conventional group accepted more blood transfusion. The modified group had a shorter duration in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, and lower total hospitalization costs than those in the conventional group. CONCLUSIONS: The modified prosthesis eversion technique is an effective alternative for proximal anastomosis in ascending aorta replacement, with less blood loss, shorter operation time, and lower rate of postoperative complications compared with the conventional technique.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, few outcome studies on sub-syndromal delirium have been reported. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence of delirium and sub-syndromal delirium as well as the risk factors and progression to delirium. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Six bed medical and surgical intensive care unit in Otsu Municipal Hospital in Japan. METHODS: Delirium and sub syndromal delirium were evaluated using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist scores and the demographic data of the patients recorded. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test for comparison. We also compared groups using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of the 380 patients who were screened, 15.8% and 33.9% had delirium or sub syndromal delirium, respectively and 9.5% of patients progressed from a state of sub syndromal delirium to delirium. Older age, predisposing cognitive impairment, blood transfusion, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, low red blood cell count and high C-reactive protein levels were the risk factors highly associated with subsyndromal delirium symptoms. Older age, acute admission, steroid use, the utilisation of restraints and lower PaO(2) were the determinants of progression to delirium.

Recent evidence-based perioperative care guidelines recommend limiting use of vasopressors, ventilator support, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and in-per-son flap monitoring. Here we evaluate an evidence-based free-flap management protocol implemented at our institution. Methods: Patients undergoing free-flap surgery at our institution after the new protocol implementation were prospectively enrolled. A retrospective matched control group from patients prior to new protocol implementation was selected. Rates of infection, readmission, flap complications, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared. Results: There were 61 patients in pre- and postprotocol implementation groups. Mean age was 67.8 years in the preand 59.6 years in the postprotocol group (P < .001). Patients in the new protocol group underwent less frequent flap monitoring. They were less likely to undergo tracheostomy (50.8% vs 77.0%, P < .001) or gastrostomy (50.8% vs 70.5%, P = .01) placement, or intraoperative blood transfusion (70.5% vs 86.8%, P = .04). Postimplementation patients were more likely to be off vasopressors (98.3% vs 50.8%, P < .01) and ventilator (63.9% vs 9.8%, P < .01) support at the conclusion of surgery and spent fewer days in the ICU (2.11 vs 3.39 days, P = .017). LOS, readmissions, and rates of infectious and flap-related complications did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Evidence-based practices can shorten ICU time and reduce rates of invasive interventions, use of vaso-pressors, blood transfusions, and frequent monitoring without adversely affecting outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

These patients often have recurrent hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The aim of our study is to describe and analyze the clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of 141 adult SCD patients admitted to the ICU over a 6-year period. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of 141 adult patients (>18 years) with a diagnosis of SCD hospitalized with any length of stay (LOS) in an ICU at two tertiary care centers over a six year period. Results Demographics are summarized in Table 1. Review of outpatient treatment regimens showed that while 95 percent of patients were receiving folic acid, only 36.5 percent were on hydroxyurea and 6 percent were chronic transfusion dependent. Collectively, patients had a total of 341 hospitalizations with an average of 2.6 hospitalizations per patient per year. Patients were hospitalized for an average of 2 days prior to ICU admission. Causes of admission and management are summarized in Table 1. Patients had an average of 2.8 complications on ICU presentation, the most frequent being VOC, respiratory failure, and infection (61, 42, and 29 percent, respectively). 8 percent of patients were admitted in multi-organ failure. Average ICU LOS was 3.63 days with an average hospital LOS of 15.35 days. 9 patients died (overall mortality rate 6.4 percent) with all deaths resulting from SCD-complications. Conclusion While it is known that SCD carries a high disease burden on our healthcare system, very little research has been done reviewing trends in those that become the most critically ill. This database represents the largest known retrospective review of adult patients with SCD hospitalized in an ICU. We found that patients had an average of 2.6 hospitalizations per year, with an average LOS of 15 days per admission. Only one-third of patients were on chronic maintenance therapy. Overall mortality was low, and while most presented with multiple LTC, they were successfully treated in the ICU. We hope to use this review in future studies to better evaluate sickle cell disease baseline characteristics and predictors of poor outcomes, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations, progression to critical care illness, and prolonged hospital stays.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reflect the patient inflammatory and immunity status. We investigated the role of on-admission PLR and NLR in predicting massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activation and mortality following abdominal trauma. Methods. A 4-year retrospective analysis of all adult abdominal trauma patients was conducted. Patients were classified into survivors and nonsurvivors and low vs. high PLR. The discriminatory power for PLR and NLR to predict MTP and mortality was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for predictors of mortality. Results. A total of 1199 abdominal trauma patients were included (18.7% of all the trauma admissions). Low PLR was associated with more severe injuries and greater rates of hospital complications including mortality in comparison to high PLR. On-admission PLR and NLR were higher in the survivors than in nonsurvivors (149.3 vs. 76.3 (p=0.001) and 19.1 vs. 13.7 (p=0.009), respectively). Only PLR significantly correlated with injury severity score, revised trauma score, TRISS, serum lactate, shock index, and FASILA score. Optimal cutoffs of PLR and NLR for predicting mortality were 98.5 and 18.5, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PLR were 81.3% and 61.1%, respectively, and 61.3% and 51.3%, respectively, for NLR. The AUROC for predicting MTP was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.655-0.743) for PLR and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.510-0.598) for NLR. To predict hospital mortality, the area under the curve (AUROC) for PLR was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.712-0.825) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.529-0.650) for the NLR. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the age, Glasgow Coma Scale, sepsis, injury severity score, and PLR were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion. On-admission PLR but not NLR helps early risk stratification and timely management and predicts mortality in abdominal trauma patients. Further prospective studies are required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Modulating the inflammatory response of endothelium and thrombocytes might attenuate this vicious cycle and improve outcome. Method: The CO-ILEPSS trial was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock were randomised and allocated in a 2:1 ratio to active treatment with dual therapy of iloprost 1 ng/kg/min and eptifibatide 0.5 μg/kg/min for 48 h or placebo. The primary outcomes were changes in biomarkers reflecting endothelial activation and disruption, platelet consumption and fibrinolysis. We compared groups with mixed models, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: We included 24 patients of which 18 (12 active, 6 placebo) completed the full 7-day trial period and were included in the per-protocol analyses of the primary outcomes. Direct comparison between groups showed no differences in the primary outcomes. Analyses of within-group delta values revealed that biomarkers of endothelial activation and disruption changed differently between groups with increasing levels of thrombomodulin (p = 0.03) and nucleosomes (p = 0.02) in the placebo group and decreasing levels of sE-Selectin (p = 0.007) and sVEGFR1 (p = 0.005) in the active treatment group. Platelet count decreased the first 48 h in the placebo group (p = 0.049) and increased from baseline to day 7 in the active treatment group (p = 0.023). Levels of fibrin monomers declined in the active treatment group within the first 48 h (p = 0.048) and onwards (p = 0.03). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in SOFA score from 48 h (p = 0.024) and onwards in the active treatment group. Intention-to-treat analyses of all included patients showed no differences in serious adverse events including bleeding, use of blood products or mortality. Conclusion: Our results could indicate benefit from the experimental treatment with reduced endothelial injury, reduced platelet consumption and ensuing reduction in fibrinolytic biomarkers along with improved SOFA score. The results of the CO-ILEPSS trial are exploratory and hypothesis generating and warrant further investigation in a large-scale trial.

It has three epidemiological forms: the main one, sporadic, the familial form associated with mutation of the gene encoding the prion protein and iatrogenic forms. This transmissible spongiform subacute encephalopathy is a rare disease with an incidence of one case per million inhabitants per year. The disease's neuropathological characteristics are the presence of spongiosis, neuronal death and gliosis and the accumulation of the host-encoded protein, partly resistant to proteases. The new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was described in Great-Britain in 1996 in young patients with no medical history to suggest a iatrogenic or familial origin. Hyperdense signals to cerebral MRI have been described in post-thalamic areas and can be a helpful diagnostic feature in cases with a suggestive clinical picture. This form was quickly suspected to be the consequence of infection in man with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent. To date, 130 cases have been recorded. The agent distribution in humans is largely peripheral. The safety of transplants, drugs, transfusion and regulations on the safety of hospitals need to be reassessed. From public health point of view, it is essential that all cases are identified. © 2003 Publié par Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This may be because of alterations in recipient immune responses. METHODS: This randomised trial evaluated the effect of transfusion with washed compared with unwashed PRBCs on pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial activation in 154 preterm newborns born before 29 weeks' gestation. Changes in plasma cytokines and measures of endothelial activation in recipient blood were analysed after each of the first three transfusions. RESULTS: By the third transfusion, infants receiving unwashed blood had an increase in IL-17A (P = 0.04) and TNF (P = 0.007), whereas infants receiving washed blood had reductions in IL-17A (P = 0.013), TNF (P = 0.048), IL-6 (P = 0.001), IL-8 (P = 0.037), IL-12 (P = 0.001) and IFN-γ (P = 0.001). The magnitude of the post-transfusion increase in cytokines did not change between the first and third transfusions in the unwashed group but decreased in the washed group for IL-12 (P = 0.001), IL-17A (P = 0.01) and TNF (P = 0.03), with the difference between the groups reaching significance by the third transfusion (P < 0.001 for each cytokine). CONCLUSION: The pro-inflammatory immune response to transfusion in preterm infants can be modified when PRBCs are washed prior to transfusion. Further studies are required to determine whether the use of washed PRBCs for neonatal transfusion translates into reduced morbidity and mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Although there is increased understanding of clinical factors associated with severe disease, studies investigating biomarkers to predict severity and uncover treatment targets are still needed. Polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipid mediators (PUFA-LM) can promote inflammation or resolution of inflammation. Previous research showed differences in PUFA-LM expression in septic patients that developed ARDS. Here we evaluate the plasma PUFA-LM profile at admission in 20 patients with COVID-19 and correlate our findings with disease severity. Methods: Blood was collected at admission from 41 patients with COVID-19 at Virginia Commonwealth University between April and July, 2020. Platelet poor plasma from 20 patients were selected; 10 with nonsevere COVID19 (NSC) defined by <4L O2 need and 10 severe COVID-19 subjects (SC) defined as requiring admission to the intensive care unit, for PUFA-LM analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Patients with active malignancy were excluded. Results: Demographic data and comorbidities are similar between the two groups. Both cohorts were predominately African American (80%) and male (60%). The SC cohort exhibited higher levels of lipoxygenase metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs) and hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (HDoHEs), which serve as intermediates in the synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Epoxygenase metabolites were also higher in the SC cohort and were mostly diols indicating elevated epoxide hydrolase activity. Conversely PGE1 and 15-OxoETE were elevated in the NSC cohort compared to SC. Discussion: In this predominantly African-American patient cohort, admission PUFA-LM profiles differed in subjects who developed mild vs. severe COVID19. Higher levels of lipoxygenase activity in the SC cohort is of unclear significance since this pathway promotes synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Given sample collection early in the disease course it may signify incomplete synthesis of resolution mediators or increased inflammation. The higher levels of diols from epoxides are intriguing. PUFA epoxides are anti-inflammatory and prevent prostaglandins from eliciting an inflammatory response. Hence, higher levels of epoxide hydrolysis in SC cohort suggests an exacerbation of inflammation by prostaglandins. Higher levels of PGE1 (a known pulmonary vasodilator) and 15-OxoETE (an anti-inflammatory mediator which inhibits NFκB activation) in the NSC group may contribute to a dampening of inflammatory response in NSC cohort. Overall, this data suggests a complex interplay of dysfunctional homeostatic and inflammatory mechanisms early in disease which may contribute to development of severe COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

function and are now known to modulate innate immune cells. Leukocyte-platelet aggregations and activation-induced secretome are among factors recently gaining interest but little is known about their interplay with severity and mortality during the course of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The aim of the present work is to follow platelets’ bioenergetics, redox balance, and calcium homeostasis as regulators of leukocyte-platelet interactions in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with variable clinical severity and mortality outcomes. We investigated COVID-19 infection-related changes in platelet counts, activation, morphology (by flow cytometry and electron microscopy), bioenergetics (by Seahorse analyzer), mitochondria function (by high resolution respirometry), intracellular calcium (by flow cytometry), reactive oxygen species (ROS, by flow cytometry), and leukocyte-platelet aggregates (by flow cytometry) in non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Non-ICU, n=15), ICU-survivors of severe COVID-19 (ICU-S, n=35), non-survivors of severe COVID-19 (ICU-NS, n=60) relative to control subjects (n=31). Additionally, molecular studies were carried out to follow gene and protein expressions of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (ETC) in representative samples of isolated platelets from the studied groups. Our results revealed that COVID-19 infection leads to global metabolic depression especially in severe patients despite the lack of significant impacts on levels of mitochondrial ETC genes and proteins. We also report that severe patients’ platelets exhibit hyperpolarized mitochondria and significantly lowered intracellular calcium, concomitantly with increased aggregations with neutrophil. These changes were associated with increased populations of giant platelets and morphological transformations usually correlated with platelets activation and inflammatory signatures, but with impaired exocytosis. Our data suggest that hyperactive platelets with impaired exocytosis may be integral parts in the pathophysiology dictating severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The consent process included a discussion of the management of bleeding and hemostasis in the perioperative period in the context of the patients' religious choice and the possible consequences of avoiding transfusion in massive bleeding. The medical team agreed to abide by the patient's wishes with respect to the blood and blood products deemed unacceptable by the patient irrespective of the consequences. The consent included a discussion of manufactured hemostatic agents that are designated by the Hospital Liaison Committee Network for Jehovah's Witnesses as subject to personal decision. There was also a discussion of recombinant agents available, all of which are acceptable to Jehovah's Witness patients. The patient accepted the use of cryoprecipitate, prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa. CLINICAL FEATURES: After separation from cardiopulmonary bypass and protamine administration, blood loss was 350 mL over a ten-minute period. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 3.5 at that time. Cryoprecipitate 15 U, 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin 16 U, and a prothrombin complex concentrate, Octaplex®, 60 mL were administered. Blood loss improved significantly. The INR in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit was 1.3. The sample was taken approximately one hour following the administration of the hemostatic agents.

Conventionally, blood component therapy delivery is measured by 24-h cumulative totals and ratios. The study aim was to examine the effect of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) on early (6h) balanced component therapy. Methods: An 88-month retrospective clinical study at a level 1 trauma centre was undertaken, examining consecutive trauma patients receiving ≥10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24h, before (pre-MTP) and after implementation of MTP. Demographic data, injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), shock parameters, coagulation profile, the need for surgical intervention (<24h), mortality and intensive care unit length of stay were collected. The ratios of blood products given by 6h, by 24h and the time between administrations of components was collected and analysed. Results: Pre-MTP and MTP patients had similar demographics, shock severity and initial laboratory findings. Despite MTP patients having had a higher ISS (42 ± 12 versus 36 ± 12, P < 0.05) and AIS head score (2.6 ± 1.8 versus 1.6 ± 2.0, P < 0.05), there was no difference in mortality. Area under the curve (AUC) of the MTP period showed earlier delivery of higher median ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/PRBC (P= 0.004). Similar findings were found for cryoprecipitate/PRBC and platelet/PRBC ratios. By 24h, the AUC for FFP/PRBC ratios were no different. Discussion: Implementation of MTP resulted in earlier balanced transfusion. The difference between the FFP/PRBC ratios of the two types of resuscitations levelled by 24h. The efficacy of component therapy delivery should be measured earlier than 24h. © 2012 The Authors.

Few, however, have evaluated the impact of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of FFP transfusion on mortality in critically injured TBI patients. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 632 consecutive trauma patients diagnosed with CT Scan-confirmed TBI. Data collected included age, gender, race, mechanism of injury (MOI), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and head Abbreviatied Injury Score (HAIS). Admission coagulation profile, total number of FFP and pRBC units transfused in the 1st 24-hours of hospital admission, mortality, ICU days, and hospital length of stay (HLOS) were also evaluated. RESULTS: 74% of patients were male (N=469) and majority were Caucasian (N=399). Mean age, ISS, and HAIS scores were 43 ± 21 years, 31 ± 12, and 4 ± 1, respectively.Mean number of ICU days and HLOS were 13 ± 10 and 16 ± 12 days, respectively. Overall mortality rate was 18.5%. 254 patients received FFP while 235 patients received pRBC transfusions in the 1st 24-hours of admission. Mean number of FFP and pRBC units transfused in the 1st 24-hours of admission were 2 ± 5 and 2 ± 6 units, respectively. Logistic regression analysis, controlling for demographic data, MOI, ISS, HAIS, and baseline coagulation profile show that increasing number of units of FFP transfused in the 1st 24-hours of admission was found to be significantly associated with higher mortality (OR=1.08, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: FFP transfusion is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Further research regarding the potential etiology of this finding in TBI patients is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: A 78-year-old man presented to us with tremors and difficulty speaking fluently of 3 days duration. The tremor was of sudden onset and was first noticed on his right hand and subsequently involved all parts of his body. Two days before the onset of symptoms, he had taken artesunate tablets for acute malaria. Neurological examination revealed florid cerebellar signs (ataxia, nystagmus, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia). BrainMRI showed mild generalized cerebellar atrophy. Chest-X-ray and abdominopelvic ultrasound scan showed normal findings. Complete blood count, lipid profile, and renal indices were all within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 33mm/hr, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 4ng/ml. Blood film for malaria parasite was [+]. He was seronegative for HIV 1 and 2. Syphilis serology (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) was also negative. He was managed conservatively in the intensive care unit. His symptoms resolved dramatically over a five day period. He was discharged home in good condition. Results: Acute florid cerebellar symptoms and signs.

We sought to investigate the attitudes and clinical practice regarding the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) with a focus on NIV in pediatric ICUs. Method: Members of the French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care Emergencies (GFRUP) were asked to complete an online survey on physicians’ attitudes toward children with ACS admitted to the PICU during 2015. Results: The survey was answered by teams from 17 PICUs (240 beds). In total, 15 centers (88%) had a local transfusion unit and 14 (82%) worked in connection with a sickle cell disease (SCD) reference center. During 2015, 360 patients with SCD were managed (median: 7 per center; 21) of whom 137 (38%) for an ACS (median: 4 ACS per center; 8). The median length of PICU stay for ACS was 5 days (3.1). Among the 137 patients who presented with ACS, 73 (53%) received simple blood transfusion and 16 (12%) received exchange transfusion. For patients who required noninvasive ventilatory support, NIV with bilevel pressure (BiPAP) was the most frequent method (n = 68, 50%), followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 23, 17%) and high‐flow oxygen (n = 21, 15%). The proportion of patients on BiPAP was up to 71% in the centers most frequently managing ACS patients.

Of all trauma patient subgroups it has been anticipated that this patient group would most benefit from advanced prehospital interventions as hypoxia and hypotension have been demonstrated to be associated with poor outcomes and these factors may be amenable to prehospital intervention. Supporting evidence is largely lacking however. In particular the efficacy of early anaesthesia/muscle relaxant assisted intubation has proved difficult to substantiate. METHODS: This article describes the design and protocol of the Head Injury Retrieval Trial (HIRT) which is a randomised controlled single centre trial of physician prehospital care (delivering advanced interventions such as rapid sequence intubation and blood transfusion) in addition to paramedic care for severe blunt TBI compared with paramedic care alone. RESULTS: Primary endpoint is Glasgow Outcome Scale score at six months post injury. Issues with trial integrity resulting from drop ins from standard care to the treatment arm as the result of policy changes by the local ambulance system are discussed. CONCLUSION: This randomised controlled trial will contribute to the evaluation of the efficacy of advance prehospital interventions in severe blunt TBI.

Secondary brain damage in this model was characterized by progressive cortical hyperperfusion, edema, and BBB disruption in the vicinity of the hemispheroid lesion occurring acutely after injury. The histopathological evolution was followed for up to 4 days. Neuronal damage in the cortex and the hippocampus (CA-1) was assessed quantitatively, revealing secondary and progressive loss of neuronal tissue within the first 24 hours following injury. Pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 ameliorated the severe hypoperfusion in 12 rats (increasing local cerebral blood flow from a mean ± standard error of the mean of 40.5% ± 8.3% to 80.2% ± 7.8%, p < 0.01) and reduced edema by 70% in 10 rats (p < 0.05) acutely after injury. The PAF antagonist also reduced the progression of neuronal damage in the cortex and the CA-1 hippocampal neurons (decrease of neuronal death from 88.0% ± 3.9% to 49.8% ± 4.2% at 24 hours in the cortex and from 40.2 ± 5.0% to 13.2% ± 2.1% in the hippocampus in 30 rats; p < 0.05). This study provides evidence to support progressive brain damage following focal brain injury, associated with secondary loss of neuronal cells. In this latter process, PAF antagonists may provide significant therapeutic protection in arresting secondary brain damage following cerebral ischemia and neurological trauma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The present study evaluates the experience of blunt liver injury in adults in a Swedish university hospital. Material and Methods: Forty-six patients with blunt liver trauma were treated from January 1994 through to December 2004. Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively to examine injury severity score (ISS), liver injury grade, diagnostics, treatment and outcome. Results: Thirty-five patients (76%) were initially treated non-operatively and 11 (24%) patients had immediate surgery. In four (11%) patients, NOM failed and the patients required surgery 8-72 h after admission. Patients failing non-operative care had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure on admission as compared with patients with successful NOM (P = 0.001). Patients immediately operated upon had higher ISS (P < 0.001) and were haemodynamically unstable to a greater extent (P < 0.001) as compared with patients initially considered for NOM. Operated patients had increased transfusion requirements (P < 0.001), longer total hospital stay (P = 0.011) and stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) unit (P < 0.001) as compared with NOM. One immediately operated and one failed NOM died (total mortality 4%). Seventeen patients in the NOM group were successfully treated without surgery despite the presence of at least one described risk factor. Conclusions: Most patients with blunt liver trauma can be treated without surgery, and non-operative management may be performed even in the presence of established risk factors. © 2009 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DESIGN: Propensity score-matched analysis. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three cardiac surgery patients receiving rFVIIa compared with 23 matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: An intravenous bolus of rFVIIa (70 μg/kg) was administered at the end of a complete transfusion protocol. Five patients received rFVIIa in the operating room, and 18 patients received rFVIIa in the intensive care unit. Four of the intensive care unit patients required a second dose. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood loss and transfusion requirements were significantly reduced in the period after rFVIIa administration. A highly significant reduction in hourly blood loss was found at -1 hr vs. 0 hrs and 0 hrs vs. 1 hr (-194 and -77.5 mL, respectively; both adjusted p < .001). In addition, significant improvements of international normalized ratio (p < .001), partial thromboplastin time (p < .001), platelet count (p < .001), fibrinogen (p < .001), and antithrombin (p < .001) were detected after rFVIIa administration. The two groups did not differ regarding adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa was successfully used as an additional therapy both during and after acute aortic dissection surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, when bleeding was refractory to conventional methods.

Indeed, allo-SCT is associated with potentially life-threatening complications such as conditioning-regimen toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse. Several studies suggest that ICU admission may fail to provide benefits with a mortality rate attaining 95% in a subset of allo-SCT patients. Therefore, ICU triage policies have been set in order to identify patients who have the best chances of recovering from life-threatening complications. Not only were those policies based on studies that were restricted to patients admitted to ICU, but they also included very heterogeneous cohorts of patients in terms of underlying disease, patients characteristics and transplantations modalities. In addition, interpretation of the data is confounded by the inclusion of both autologous and allogeneic SCT patients and the absence of a clear distinction between acute, chronic and refractory GVHD. With the purpose of identifying factors that affect overall survival (OS), we conducted a retrospective multicenter study on a homogenous cohort. The aim of this study was to establish a new prognostic score usable in screening patients requiring ICU and bases on early post-transplant complications. Patients and methods Transplantation modalities were made as homogeneous as possible using the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: (i) Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome aged more than 18 years referred for first allo-SCT following RIC with at least one year of follow-up (ii) source of stem cell was marrow or blood from either a sibling or an HLA-identical unrelated donor at allelic level (so called 10/10). Patients who received allo-SCT from an HLA-mismatched donor, cord blood or T-cell-depleted graft were excluded as well as patients with CMML. Consequently, 275 consecutive patients with MDS who underwent allo-SCT between January 1999 and December 2009 in 24 French and Belgian centers were identified. Patient and donor characteristics, transplantation modalities and complications occurred within 100 days after transplant were considered for univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate prognostic factors by backward stepwise analysis of the factors considered significant in univariate analysis. A prognostic score for 3-year OS was designed using the variables from the multivariate model and according to the rounded HRs values. Risk categories derived from this score were compared using log-rank test. Results In multivariate analysis, 3-year OS was influenced by grade III/IV acute GVHD [HR=2.8; CI95=1.8-4.3; p<0.001], relapse before d+100 after transplant [HR=3; CI95=1.9-4.7; p<0.001), and the lack of platelet recovery (defined as the first occurrence of a stable platelet count ≥ 20G/L before d+100, persisting for more than 7 days without transfusion) [HR=6.6; CI95=4.1-10.6; p<0.001]. Therefore, a prognostic score was based on grade III/IV acute GVHD (1 point), relapse before d+100 (1point), lack of platelet recovery (2 points). Thus, this score discriminated three risk groups: good (score=0; n=191, 3-year OS=63%), intermediate (score=1; n=50; 3-year OS=20%) and poor (score≥2; n=34; 3-year OS=3%) p<0.001.

GPA is a rare disease in childhood, with an estimated annual incidence of less than one per one million children. Common clinical presentations of GPA include fatigue, fever, weight loss, arthralgias, rhinosinusitis, cough, and urinary abnormalities. We present the case of GPA masquerading as an asthma exacerbation in a pre-adolescent female. CASE DESCRIPTION An 8-year-old Hispanic female previously diagnosed with asthma was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after presenting with dyspnea, increased work of breathing, and diffuse wheezing. Pertinent diagnostics on admission included a mild leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 101, a positive polymerase chain reaction for mycoplasma pneumoniae, and a CXR with concerns for a right lower lobe consolidation. The patient appeared to respond to a combination of bronchodilators, intravenous methylprednisone, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; however, attempts to discontinue systemic steroids were met with clinical decompensation. On hospital day 5, the patient had an isolated episode of hemoptysis. Further questioning revealed that the patient had recently been diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis by an ophthalmologist and had several months of a migratory polyarthritis which she was waiting to undergo clinical evaluation for. In response to her hemoptysis, a Chest CT and broadened laboratory investigation was performed. The Chest CT demonstrated non-specific ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe in addition to a small nodule; there were cavitary lesions. Additional pertinent lab findings included a positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anit-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies, and a urinalysis showing both proteinuria and hematuria. These results made clinicians suspect a systemic vasculitis and ultimately the patient had a renal biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. DISCUSSION This case of an 8-year-old female presenting in acute respiratory failure secondary to GPA mimicking an asthma exacerbation adds yet another clinical presentation to a disease rarely seen in pediatrics. While there are reports of children as young as 7-year-old being diagnosed with GPA, most case series describe subglottic stenosis, glomerulonephritis, and prominent constitutional symptoms as presenting features. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of literature, this case is significant because it adds yet another clinical presentation of a rare disease. In this case, the rare disease imitated a much more common disease, asthma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

As a result, age-specific recommendations in the setting of trauma have undergone considerable discussion. This review aims to identify strategies for optimal management of geriatric trauma patients. Specifically, it will focus on updated triage criteria and system-level enhancements to improve the management of geriatric trauma patients. Recent Findings: The optimal care for geriatric trauma patients is centered around treating acute injuries while minimizing the impact of comorbidities. Recent research has focused on early identification of high-risk patients through adjustments to triage criteria that reflect common changes in geriatric physiology while also emphasizing frailty over age. Additionally, recent changes to common medications, such as anticoagulant and anti-platelet therapy, have required special consideration for management of these patients secondary to the increased risk of poor outcomes. Finally, recent evidence has strongly supported the creation of multi-disciplinary teams that focus on the care of geriatric trauma patients. These changes have been shown to improve mortality and decrease in-hospital adverse events. Summary: The management of geriatric trauma patients is a complex endeavor that requires a concerted effort from triage to discharge. This review provides a broad overview of issues affecting geriatric trauma and delves into potential solutions to adequately manage patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

According to the therapy method, we divided the patients into 2 groups: DC group and standard care group. Between 2010 and 2014, a total number of 223 severe TBI patients, containing 112 patients undergoing DC and 111 patients undergoing standard care, were enrolled into the study according to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The long-term prognosis was evaluated by Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 12 months after discharging from hospital. We used univariate analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves to explore prognostic predictors. The results showed that patients in the DC group had a lower mortality, but there was no statistical significance in long-term prognosis between these 2 groups. It seemed that admission GCS, platelet, neutrophile granulocyte, total protein, and albumin were associated with long-term prognosis in DC group and reactivity of pupils in standard care group. Simultaneously, using the multivariable logistic regression model, we confirmed that admission GCS and albumin were independent prognostic predictors for patients undergoing DC, and reactivity of pupils for those undergoing standard care. Our data suggested that DC was an effective therapy for severe TBI patients in reducing mortality, but it failed to improve long-term prognosis. Through our study, we could comprehend the characteristics of the 2 treatments and provide more scientific individuation therapy for severe TBI patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Primary treatment of patients suffering from acute pancreatitis is conservative independent of its etiology and initial severity. There is no effective specific therapy for treating the underlying disease process. Therefore, the therapeutic approach at present is one of supportive care, abolishment of causative (biliary tract) disease and treatment of complications. Since complications may develop at any time, patients with moderate or severe disease should be admitted to an intensive care unit for interdisciplinary assessment and continuous observation of their clinical status. Basic therapy should include total fasting, heparin, replacement of deficits in volume, electrolytes and albumin as well as sufficient analgesia. Dependent on earl patient's individual clinical condition, nasogastric suction, respiratory support, hemofiltration, antibiotics and insulin may become necessary. Most pharmacological approaches proved uneffective in clinical trials. Hopeful, but preliminary results could be achieved recently by administration of lexipafant, a high-affinity receptor antagonist of platelet-activating factor, and of pirenzepin, a M1-selective muscarinergic receptor antagonist. The use of enzyme inhibitors and drugs capable of inhibiting pancreatic exocrine secretion has not been proven to be effective in clinical trials. The value of prostaglandins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, antioxidants and free radical scavengers remains unestablished. Early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed in patients with suspected underlying biliary disease. Papillotomy should be carried out only in cases of concomitant cholangitis or when calculi are present in the common bile duct.

There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters.Results: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2).Conclusions: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by ICU stay longer than 10 days but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. This finding supports the transplantation of patients with high MELD score but only with knowledge of increased morbidity. © 2010 Oberkofler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The primary therapeutic goal in acute stroke is to achieve recanalization, but, even if successful, only less than one third of patients benefit. The phenomenon of ongoing ischemic lesion development despite recanalization is referred to as reperfusion injury. Although numerous contributing factors, like platelet adhesion, degranulation, as well as T-cell responses have been identified, the mechanistic interactions of these factors leading to brain injury remain unknown and their elucidation requires novel in vivo imaging technologies. Aims: We sought to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of platelet deposition and thrombus formation in the ischemic brain using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) in wildtype and Tcell deficient mice (Rag1 -/- ). Methods: We subjected mice to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), a model of ischemic stroke. Brains were antibodystained for platelets and endothelial cells, paraformaldehyde-fixed and chemically cleared. Entire hemispheres were imaged via LSFM and thrombus formation was mapped. Results: We established a protocol for antibody penetration, tissue clearing, and triple-color illumination allowing the visualization of platelet deposition in an intact brain hemisphere. This approach allowed us to generate a spatio-temporal map of thrombotic activity in the microcirculation of the ischemic brain, revealing the gradual increase of formed thrombi, while an unexpectedly high number of brain vessels remained perfused. Strikingly, T-cell deficient mice displayed dramatically reduced numbers of thrombi in the ischemic brain, despite normal thrombus formation in models of arterial thrombosis. Conclusion: This novel method allows a spatio-temporal mapping of cell-cell interactions during cerebral infarct progression, thereby revealing fundamental pathomechanisms of thrombo-inflammation in the ischemic brain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

TTP is usually caused by deficient activity of von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13), due to either gene mutations or acquired via anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. It can be triggered by bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, cardiothoracic-, abdominal-, and orthopedic surgeries, infections including very rarely Helicobacter pylori infection. CASE REPORT Here we report a case of a 16-year-old male with TTP, who presented with thrombocytopenia before an appendectomy. Seven days after surgery, our patient started to vomit, developed melena, and was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with clinical presentation of shock. Gastroscopy revealed H. pylori positive hemorrhagic gastritis. The patient was treated by erythrocyte transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, human albumin, glucose-electrolyte solutions, vitamin K, platelet transfusion before implantation of central venous catheter, and antibiotics. After 36 hours, we started plasma exchange (PEX). Blood tests showed deficiency of ADAMTS13. Due to the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, rituximab was administered. Due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, he was artificially ventilated. Brain MR angiography showed small ischemic cerebro-vascular insult in the arteria cerebri media region. Despite immunosuppressive therapy and PEX, the patient did not improve completely until the H. pylori infection was eradicated. After which, he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of TTP accompanied with appendicitis and gastritis caused by H. pylori, where TTP improvement was dependent on H. pylori infection eradication.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The goal of this prospective study is to apply the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) Score, which was established by Scientific and Standardisation Committee (SSC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for burn trauma. We were monitoring the evolution of hemocoagulation laboratory parameters (APTT, PT, Ddimers, Fibrinogen and Platelet count) during the hospitalisation of severely burned patients and also of patients with smaller deep burns. Methods: A total of 100 patients have been included to our study. We have taken blood from patients repeatedly to evaluate the hemocoagulation parameters (on the day of admission, the 5th posttraumatic day, the day after necrectomy and autologous split-thickness skin grafting and on the day of discharge. Thenwe made a calculation ISTH overt DIC score and evaluation. Results: Part 1. In severely burned patients hospitalized at the ICU on the day of injury the overtDIC score reached 1.25 (0-3), the 5th day after the injury it was 1.83 (0-3, 1 day after the necrectomy + STSG it was 2.08 (0-3) and on the day of discharge 0.00. In the patients with MODS the DIC score reached the value of 2.00. Part 2: In patients with smaller deep burns the average extent of the burn area was 5.9% TBSA (0.5-12% TBSA). On the day of injury the overt DIC score reached 0.25(0-2), 5th day after the injury itwas 1.66 (0-2), 1 day after the necrectomy + STSG it was 1.83 (0-3) and on the day of discharge 0.02 (0-2). Conclusion: The evaluation of the results displays that on the day of injury the average value of the DIC score is higher in patients with severe burns than in patients with lesser extent of burn injury. In both groups it increases until the day of the necrectomy and STSG, and finally decreases slowly back to normal in healed patients. In case a patient suffers sequential multiple organ failure, the DIC score increases. The ISTH overt DIC score system can assist in more accurate diagnostics in patient with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, we enrolled 340 patients who were treated with CRRT for sepsis at the Presbyterian Medical Center. In all patients, CRRT was performed using the PRISMA platform. We divided these patients into two groups (survivors and non-survivors) according to the 28-day all-cause mortality. We compared clinical characteristics and analyzed the predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The 28-day all-cause mortality was 62%. Survivors were younger than non-survivors and had higher platelet counts (178 ± 101 × 10(3)/mL vs. 134 ± 84 × 10(3)/mL, p < .01) and serum creatinine levels (4.2 ± 2.8 vs. 3.3 ± 2.7, p < .01). However, survivors had lower red blood cell distribution width (RDW) scores (14.9 ± 2.1 vs. 16.1 ± 3.3, p < .01) and APACHE II scores (24.5 ± 5.8 vs. 26.9 ± 5.7, p < .01) than non-survivors. Furthermore, survivors were more likely than non-survivors to have a urine output of >0.05 mL/kg/h (66% vs. 86%, p = .001) in the first day. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, platelet count, RDW score, APACHE II score, serum creatinine level, and a urine output of <0.05 mL/kg/h the first day were prognostic factors for the 28-day all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Age, platelet count, APACHE II score, RDW score, serum creatinine level, and urine output the first day are useful predictors for the 28-day all-cause mortality in sepsis patients requiring CRRT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, there have been variations reported in practices with regard to method of placental transfusion, timing of cord clamping and gestational age thresholds. Furthermore, the optimal cord clamping practice in situations of depressed infants needing resuscitation or in higher-risk delivery situations, such as placental abruption, intrauterine growth restriction, multiple gestation, chorioamnionitis, maternal human immunodeficiency virus syndrome/hepatitis or maternal general anesthesia is often debated. An evaluation of these variations and exploration of associated factors was needed to optimally target opportunities for improvement and streamline research activities. The objective of this survey, specifically aimed at neonatologists working in the US was to identify and describe current cord clamping practices and evaluate factors associated with variations. STUDY DESIGN: The survey was distributed electronically to the US neonatologists in August 2019 with a reminder email sent in October 2019. Clinicians were primarily identified from Perinatal Section of AAP, with reminders also sent through various organizations including California Association of Neonatologists, Pediatrix and Envision national groups. Descriptive variables of interest included years of experience practicing neonatology, affiliation with a teaching institution, level of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and practicing region of the US. Questions on variations in cord management practices included information about center specific guideline/protocol, cord clamping practices, gestational age threshold of placental transfusion, performance of UCM and practice in higher-risk delivery situations. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.8%. Among 517 neonatologists whom responded, majority (85.5%) of the practices had a guideline and performed (81.7%) DCC in all gestational ages. The cord clamping practice was predominantly DCC and it was categorized as reporting clamping times <60 s in 46.6% and ≥60 s in 48.7% of responses. A significant association was detected between time of delay in cord clamping and region of practice. The Northeast region was more likely to clamp the cord in <60 s than other regions in the US. More than half of the providers responded not performing any UCM (57.3%) in their practice. Significant associations were detected between performance of UCM and all queried demographic variables independently. Clinicians with >20 years of experience were more likely from institutions performing UCM compared to the providers with fewer years of experience. However, teaching hospitals were less likely to perform UCM compared to non-teaching hospitals. Similarly, practices with level IV NICUs were less likely to perform UCM compared to practices with level III units. Hospitals in the Midwest region of US were less likely to perform UCM compared to hospitals in the Western region. Significant variations were also noticed for not providing placental transfusion in higher-risk deliveries. Demographic and professional factors were noted to be associated with these differences. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of practices have a guideline/protocol and are performing DCC in all gestational ages, there are variations noted with regard to timing, method, and performance in higher-risk deliveries.

Post sphincterotomy (PS) bleed, which occurs in about 2% of cases, can be immediate or, very rarely, delayed. This lady had rare, but lethal complications of ERCP such as pancreatitis, severe delayed PS bleed, and clot-induced cholangitis; which was managed endoscopically. Case Description/Methods: A 28-year-old female presented with biliary type of pain abdomen, jaundice and fever. An ultrasonography showed choledocholithiasis, 15mm of size with upstream biliary dilation. Urgent ERCP was done. After biliary cannulation, when sphincterotomy was done, and pus oozed out of the ampulla, suggestive of cholangitis. As attempts to retrieve the calculi failed, mechanical lithotripsy was done and the fragments were removed with the help of basket. After complete CBD clearance, a plastic stent was deployed. There was no immediate PS bleed. But, she developed post ERCP pancreatitis and was managed conservatively. On the 5th day, she complained of melena and syncope. She also developed high-grade fever with chills. She became toxic, with tachycardia and tachypnea. Patient was shifted to ICU, and bedside endoscopy showed bleed in the periampullary area associated with large clots. The patient was intubated because of respiratory distress and started on inotropes and blood transfusion. Again, ERCP was done and blood clots were removed from the periampullary area. The old biliary stent was removed and the CBD was swiped cleared of a large clot that had adhered inside the duct and was causing cholangitis. Multiple aliquots of dilute adrenaline was injected in the peri ampullary area till hemostasis was achieved. A new plastic biliary stent was deployed in the CBD. Post the procedure, the patient began to improve clinically. Discussion: PS bleed can be immediate or very rarely delayed. According to a multivariate analysis, factors for PS bleeding includes coagulopathy, anticoagulation use, cholangitis before ERCP, bleeding during initial sphincterotomy and lower ERCP volume centre. The only risk factor in this patient was cholangitis. There are previously 5 reported cases of delayed PS bleed that has caused clot induced cholangitis. Size of calculus, prior cholangitis, and use of mechanical lithotripsy appear to be the risk factors. Recovery depends on the timing of repeat ERCP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduce a new method to assess transfusion practice based on decision time intervals (DTIs). Each patient's intensive care (ICU) stay was segmented into a series of DTIs defined by a time interval following results of a complete blood count (CBC). We studied the presence of 17 clinical factors during each DTI whether transfusion was given or not. We used a generalized linear mixed model to assess the most influential clinical triggers for platelet transfusion. RESULTS: Among 6125 ICU patients treated between October 2016 and October 2021, we analyzed 39,745 DTIs among patients (n = 2921) who had at least one DTI with thrombocytopenia (≤150,000/μL). We found no association between platelet count and two markers of bleeding: drop in hemoglobin and chest tube drainage. We found that the majority of DTIs were associated with no platelet transfusion regardless of the platelet count; that no specific platelet value triggered transfusion; but rather that multiple clinical factors in conjunction with the platelet count influenced the decision to transfuse. DISCUSSION: DTI analysis represents a new method to assess transfusion practice that considers both transfusions given and not given, and that analyzes clinical circumstances present when decisions regarding transfusion are made. The method is easily adapted to blood components other than platelet transfusions and is easily extended to other ICU and other hospital settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Shodai""=>[""これ、迷います。改めてみていかがでしょうか？"", ""除外にしましょう""], ""takashi""=>[""血小板での輸血の有無ですが、除外がおおそうなので、Includeでもいいと思いますが、結果的にあとで除外されるとおもわれます。"", ""血小板の値が焦点の論文であるので、ぼくは除外かなと思いました。""]}",,"",,

The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with development of PICS in these patients. Methods: We reviewed available data of 68 trauma patients admitted to our center from Jan. 2008 to Mar. 2013, whose Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 16 or more and who had admitted to ICU for 10 days or more. Simple traumatic head injured patients were excluded. 16 clinical characteristics were compared between PICS group and Non-PICS group, and logistic regression analysis was performed to seek the independent contributed factors for PICS. Results: 20 patients were in PICS group and 48 patients were in Non-PICS group. In PICS group, ISS was higher (44.2±16.8 vs 33.3±12.9) (p= 0.036), bone fracture (AIS Limbs) was more occurred (3.2±2.0 vs 1.9±1.7) (p =0.012), Traumatic Bleeding Severity Score and Massive Transfusion rate was higher (21.2±9.9 vs 15.6±8.4; 70% vs 43.8%) (p=0.048; p=0.016), albumin level on arrival was lower (3.0±0.7 g/ml vs 3.5±0.5 g/ml) (p=0.014), and length of ICU stay was longer (p< 0.01) compared with Non-PICS group. There was no significant difference in age, sex, probability of survival, and mortality. Albumin level on arrival was an independent contributed factor for development of PICS (p=0.031). Conclusion: Low albumin level on arrival was risk for PICS in severe trauma patients. Length of ICU stay of PICS patients was longer than that of Non-PICS patients but there was no significant difference in the mortality between these two groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

As the indications for transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) begin to expand into a more traditional surgical cohort, it is important to review the long term outcomes of this technique. It is also relevant to compare the outcomes of a highly integrated, team orientated TAVI program to those achieved in major trials published to date. Methods: All patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI at our institution from 2008 to 2013 were included. Patients were treated using the Edwards Sapien and Sapien XT devices and included both inoperable and high-risk patients. The inoperable group included those medically inoperable and those technically inoperable due to factors such as porcelain aorta. Data was collected prospectively and mortality cross-checked against multiple sources. The TAVI team included cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, a vascular surgeon, an interventional radiologist, cardiac anaesthetists, and echocardiographic cardiologists. Results: A total of 114 patients underwent transfemoral TAVI at a mean age of 84±6years. Mean preoperative Logistic EuroSCORE was 31±16. Mean preoperative LVEF was 55 ±13% and 11.4% of patients had moderate or severe LV dysfunction. Successful deployment was achieved in 98.3% of patients planned for valve deployment, with a mean valve size of 24.9 mm, and 1 valve per patient implanted. Median ICU LOS was 26 hrs with 17.5% of patients requiring inotropic support. Thirty-day mortality was 1.8%. Other postoperative complications included stroke/TIA 2.6%, new dialysis % and transfusion 29.8%. Post-operative paravalvular regurgitation was amean of 1.8±1.1. Combined latemortality at amean of 27±17months was 29.8%. The one yearmortality for all patients was 9.6% (11/114) compared favourably with PARTNER A at 24.2% (84/348) (p<0.01). Two year mortality was 21.1%(16/76) comparedwith PARTNERAat 33.9%(116/ ) (p=0.04). Three year mortality was 33.9% (19/56) compared with PARTNER A at 44.2% (154/348). Discussion: The application of the term “heart team” should offer exactly that - a multidisciplinary and cohesive team with a common focus. Using this model we have been able to achieve excellent long-term outcomes in a cohort of high-risk and inoperable patients undergoing TAVI. These results compare favourably to the PARTNER cohort A.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are taking any oral anticoagulant (OAC) and present with acute hemorrhage (AH) or an acute bleeding concern (BC; due to a need for a procedure or requiring prolonged observation) that requires substantial intervention (e.g., admission, reversal, or transfusion). The project is enrolling patients at 30 US hospitals and the prespecified warfarin cohort has filled. Results: More than 1,250 subjects have been enrolled; of the 564 subjects in the warfarin group, average (SD) age is 70.6 (13.1) y, and 53% are male. Concomitant aspirin was reported by 46.5%, and P2Y12 inhibitors by 8.4%. After initial care, 85.1% were hospitalized, 32.2% in ICU. There were 405 (71 %) enrolled for an AH, with an average (SD) INR at presentation of 4.25 (3.79). In that group, 19.1% of presentations were potentially life-threatening; 23% had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and 43.3% had gastrointestinal bleeding. Nearly half of these patients received packed red blood cell transfusion and > 1/3 received fresh-frozen plasma (FFP); 107 (26.4%) received reversal therapy with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). In patients with BC (n=159), age and comorbidity burden were higher, as was mean INR, 5.49 (4.09); 22.6% received FFP and 13.8% received PCC. Less than 75% of these warfarin-treated patients received IV vitamin K. Hospital length of stay was 6-7 days in the warfarin cohort, regardless of subgroup; at discharge, 23.8% of AH patients and 27.0% of BC patients were restarted on an OAC. Of 11 patients who died in-hospital, 10 were BC patients and 1 had an ICH. Conclusions: Presentation with AH or BC in ED patients taking warfarin is associated with advanced age, supratherapeutic INR, and concomitant antiplatelet therapy, and is often not managed per guidelines. Vitamin K, while not an acute reversal agent, is underutilized. Despite evidence indicating PCC is superior to FFP for factor repletion, FFP is often given acutely.

We prospectively analysed the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with CP in order to investigate predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay at a single center in Brazil. Study Design/Methods: Thirty COVID-19 patients laboratory-confirmed by RTPCR with severe pneumonia were recruited at a single center in Brazil. Doses of 300-600ml of CP were administered. Primary outcomes were ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation support.The following variables were analysed: Severity organ failure assessment score(SOFA) at day 0 (day of CP transfusion), patient ABO blood group, concomitant use of any other therapies (hydroxychloroquine, azythromicin, tocilizumab, immunoglobulin), neutralizing antibody titers of the patients prior to transfusion (NAbsP) and total titers of neutralizing antibody from CP units transfused (NAbsCP). NAbsCP considers the total amount of antibodies transfused to account for volume differences. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. Results/Findings: In our case series, SOFA at day 0, ABO group, and both NAbs P and NAbsCP were predictive factors of ICU length of stay. At each point increased in SOFA, ICU length of stay was 38.7% longer (MR: 1.387 CI 95% 1.254-1.534, p<0.001). Group A had36.1% longer ICU length of stay (MR: 0.639 CI 95% 0.417-0.980, p 0.04). Increases of 100 units in NAbsP resulted in 1% reduction of ICU lenght of stay (MR 0.990 CI 95% 0.982-0.998, p 0.017). Similar results were obtained with NAbs-CP, with 2% reduction in ICU length of stay (MR 0.980 CI95% 0.968-0.993, p 0.002) at each 100 unit increase. Use of other therapies did not influence ICU lenght of stay (p 0.373). We perform the same analysis for duration of mechanical ventilation support, and all the variables failed to demonstrate any association Conclusions: Our findings suggest that severity of disease prior to transfusion, ABO group, patient capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies and transfusion of CP with high titer NAbs are significant predictive factors for ICU length of stay. High titer NAbs CP may add benefit to these patients. No association was found between these same variables and duration of mechanical ventilation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The choice of access between peripheral (subclavian/axillary and carotid) and central (transapical and transaortic) alternative access TAVR has not been investigated. Methods Using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry with linkage to Medicare claims, patients ≥ 65 years of age who underwent alternative access TAVR from June 1st, 2015-June 30th, 2018 were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to determine the association of access site with the endpoints of 30-day, and 1-year mortality. Results Alternative access TAVR was performed in a total of 7,187 patients of which 3462 (48%) had central access, and 3725 (52%) had peripheral access. The use of peripheral access increased over the study period (Figure). Central access patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease, history of TIA, hypertension, prior MI/CABG, atrial fibrillation, porcelain aorta, and hostile chest. Peripheral access patients had a higher prevalence of recent heart failure and severe COPD. Unadjusted all-cause mortality was significantly lower in peripheral access group at 30-days [2.9% vs 6.3% <0.001] and one-year [20.3% vs 26.6% <0.001]. However, stroke rates were higher in those with peripheral access at 30-days [5% vs 2.8% <0.001] and one-year [7.33% vs 5.54% <0.001]. These results were persistent after adjustment at one-year (Death HR 0.72 [95% CI: 0.62-0.85] and Stroke HR 2.92 [2.21 - 3.85]). Peripheral access had lower rates of blood transfusion, new onset of atrial fibrillation and decreased ICU and hospital length of stay(all p<0.05). Conclusion Peripheral access was more frequently used in recent years and was associated with lower mortality and shorter length of stay, but a higher stroke rate compared to central access. Peripheral access TAVR may be the preferred approach for alternative access although further effort to reduce stroke is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We describe surgical technique and present perioperative and oncologic outcomes of 23 consecutive cases of completely intracorporeal robot-assisted radical nephrectomy with IVC level I (17,9%) II (30%) and III (52,1%) tumor thrombectomy. Materials & Methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients with renal tumor and IVC thrombus were treated between July 2011 and September 2017. Baseline, perioperative and follow-up data were collected into prospectively maintained IRB approved databases. Surgical technique has been previously described. We report perioperative and oncologic outcomes of 23 consecutive patients treated in a tertiary referral center. Results: All procedures were successfully completed; open conversion wasn't necessary. Median operative time was 300 minutes. Eleven patients (47.8%) did not experience any complication. Ten patients (43,4%) required blood transfusion (Clavien grade 2); one patient (4,3%) had a Clavien grade 3a complication (gastroscopy); one patients (4,3%) had Clavien grade 3b complication (reintervention due to bleeding from adrenal gland); two patients (8,6%) required ICU admission (Clavien 4a), for PRESS syndrome and atrial fibrillation, respectively. Out of 8 patients who underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy, at a median follow-up of 19 months (IQR 6-31), 2-yr cancer specific and overall survival rates were 50%. Fifteen patients received surgery with curative intent and 7 of these experienced disease recurrence. three patients died of disease progression; 2-yr disease-free and cancer specific survival rates were 42.1% and 71.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Robotic IVC tumor thrombectomy has demonstrated to be a feasible and safe surgical procedure in tertiary referral centers. Favorable perioperative outcomes represent a rational base to expand indications also in the cytoreductive setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. Study design: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. Results: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1–3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5–16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1−18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4–45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108). When tested between 25 and 42 h after delivery, 4/29 (13.7 %) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise. There were no other differences in maternal, obstetrical or neonatal outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Prenatal diagnosis is based mainly on the detection of HCMV infection in the amniotic fluid and on ultrasound (US) examination. The major limitation of these techniques is that US identifies prenatally up to 15-20% of infected babies and that positive results of amniotic fluids tests do not discriminate between the infants who will have symptoms at birth and those who will not. Brief introduction: The aims of this study are to evaluate the usefulness of foetal cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) and biological parameters in foetal blood when a high HCMV load is detected in amniotic fluid. The results of MR and foetal blood testing were correlated with the foetal histological examination or neonatal outcome. Methods: We enrolled 16 women at 20-21 weeks gestation with documented intrauterine transmission of HCMV (amniotic fluid with a viral load more than 105 copies/mL) with or without abnormal ultrasound findings. All pregnant women performed cerebral MR at 21 weeks gestation. Eleven women elected to terminate the pregnancy and foetal blood was collected from the umbilical cord immediately after delivery. Quantification of viral load, HCMV-specific IgM serology, blood count and lymphocyte typing were performed on foetal blood. HCMV antigen expression and inflammatory response were studied in all foetal tissues using immunohistochemical staining procedures. Five pregnancies continued up to term and foetal MR was repeated at 32 weeks of gestation. Results: We found no evidence of brain HCMV infection by immunohistochemistry in 4 out of 11 foetuses and US and MR brain imaging were both normal in these cases. Seven foetal brains were HCMV positive and a brain histological damage was observed. Among these only in 3 out of 7 cases (43%) of US and MR imaging findings were both pathological. The most prevalent finding were periventricular hyperechogenicity (US) and cortical malformations (MR). In foetal blood only thrombocytopenia was associated significantly (p < 0.05) with the brain damage determined by histology. None of the other parameters were significantly associated with the outcome. Among newborns, two were asymptomatic and three had symptomatic infection. The two newborns with an asymptomatic infection had normal US and MR brain imaging. Only one out of three (33%) newborns with symptomatic infection had a periventricular hyperechogenicity detected by US and a normal MR brain imaging. Conclusion: In this small number of foetuses/newborns studied, foetal MR imaging do not contribute more information to US as a prognostic marker of adverse outcome, whereas foetal platelet count determination appears to be the only biological parameter in foetal blood associated significantly with the outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Nine and 21 subjects had planned cesarean hysterectomy before and after implementation of the new procedures, respectively. Overall, there was an increase in volume of cases and depth of placental invasion but no change in the demographic characteristics of patients. Additionally, we found decreased blood loss, decreased blood transfusions from a median of 2 units to 0 units, and decreased intensive care unit admission rates from 22.2% to 4.8%, but these results did not reach statistical significance.

Therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is standard care for neonatal encephalopathy; however, its benefit in inflammation-sensitized HI (IS-HI) is unknown. METHODS: Twelve newborn piglets received a 2 µg/kg bolus and 1 µg/kg/h infusion over 52 h of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HI was induced 4 h after LPS bolus. After HI, piglets were randomized to HT (33.5 °C 1-25 h after HI, n = 6) or normothermia (NT, n = 6). Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) was recorded and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was acquired at 24 and 48 h. At 48 h, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive brain cell death, microglial activation/proliferation, astrogliosis, and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) were quantified. Hematology and plasma cytokines were serially measured. RESULTS: Two HT piglets died. aEEG recovery, thalamic and white matter MRS lactate/N-acetylaspartate, and TUNEL-positive cell death were similar between groups. HT increased microglial activation in the caudate, but had no other effect on glial activation/proliferation. HT reduced CC3 overall. HT suppressed platelet count and attenuated leukocytosis. Cytokine profile was unchanged by HT. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe protection with HT in this piglet IS-HI model based on aEEG, MRS, and immunohistochemistry. Immunosuppressive effects of HT and countering neuroinflammation by LPS may contribute to the observed lack of HT efficacy. Other immunomodulatory strategies may be more effective in IS-HI. IMPACT: Acute infection/inflammation is known to exacerbate perinatal brain injury and can worsen the outcomes in neonatal encephalopathy. Therapeutic HT is the current standard of care for all infants with NE, but the benefit in infants with coinfection/inflammation is unknown. In a piglet model of inflammation (LPS)-sensitized HI, we observed no evidence of neuroprotection with cooling for 24 h, based on our primary outcome measures: aEEG, MRS Lac/NAA, and histological brain cell death. Additional neuroprotective agents, with beneficial immunomodulatory effects, require exploration in IS-HI models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The resuscitation continuum emphasizes the effect that initial therapy has on the outcome of the trauma patient. The initiation of this continuum begins with prompt field medical care and efficient transportation to designated trauma centers, where lifesaving procedures are immediately undertaken. Resuscitation with packed red blood cells and plasma, in parallel with surgical or interventional radiologic source control of bleeding, are the cornerstones of trauma management. Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy can assist with resuscitation. Tranexamic acid is used in Europe with good results, but the drug is slowly being added to the pharmacy formulary of trauma centers in United States. Recombinant factor VIIa can correct abnormal coagulation values, but its outcome benefit is less clear. Vasopressin shows promise in animal studies and case reports, but has not been subjected to a large clinical trial. The concept of ""early goal-directed therapy"" used in sepsis may be applicable in trauma as well. An early, appropriately aggressive resuscitation with blood products, as well as adjunctive pharmacologic therapy, may attenuate the systemic inflammatory response of trauma. Future investigations will need to determine whether this approach offers a similar survival benefit.

Early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate measures can improve outcomes. In most institutions, including our own, SCD patients presenting out of hours are seen at the emergency department (ED) and admitted from there by the general medical team on take until the haematology team take over. With that in mind, we organised a campaign to raise awareness among non-haematology colleagues who are involved in the management of this group of patients. The key points of our campaign were: 1) provide a simple definition of ACS: any patient with SCD with new CXR changes. 2) Dispel the myth that ACS always has a dramatic presentation; most cases present at an early stage with more subtle features. Correct diagnosis at that stage and appropriate management may obviate evolution to a more severe form. 3) No diagnosis of pneumonia should be made for SCD patients. The diagnosis has to be ACS; patients diagnosed with ACS will be treated for pneumonia whereas patients diagnosed with pneumonia will not be managed appropriately for ACS. 4) Provide an algorithm for early recognition of ACS and patients at high risk for ACS and specific management steps and 5) emphasize that ACS cannot be over-diagnosed but can be easily missed. Our strategy was to target three key areas: the ED, the acute admissions unit (AAU) and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Critical Care Outreach Team (CCOT). The first step was to identify and approach a consultant and a senior nurse in each department that would act as “champions” of the campaign in their respective area. Subsequently, teaching sessions for junior and senior doctors as well as nurses were delivered by the lead haematology consultant in all three departments and the teaching material was passed on to the respective “champions” that would organise periodic updates of their staff. At the same time, a standard operational policy (SOP) for early recognition and management of ACS was created by the lead haematology consultant for ED. ED staff review one SOP every week day at handover for five days on a rotational basis leading to familiarisation of junior doctors and nurses. A diagnosis of ACS in ED will trigger informing immediately the on-call haematology consultant as well as the ICU/ CCOT and ensure timely institution of appropriate measures. The ED SOP was made available to AAU and ICU/CCOT as well. For patients requiring an emergency out-of-hours exchange transfusion there is an established protocol for performance of those in ICU by the ICU nurses. While our focus has been these three areas, we also provided ad hoc teaching to medical junior doctors and made a presentation at the medical unit meeting where many medical consultants were present. The last step was to create posters displayed throughout the hospital. The reaction of all colleagues involved was extremely positive and enthusiastic. Only a few days after the ITU/CCOT teaching, a patient who was admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia was rightly identified by CCOT as ACS; she underwent emergency exchange transfusion with great clinical improvement and was discharged 2 days later. The aim of this campaign is to create a seamless pathway for patients with ACS or high risk for ACS and this can only be achieved with close collaboration with many different teams.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Several anti‐inflammatory medications have been studied in COVID‐19 patients. Xanthohumol (Xn), a natural extract from hop cones, possesses strong anti‐inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of Xn on the inflammatory response and the clinical outcome of COVID‐19 patients. Methods: Adult patients treated for acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 less than 150) were studied. Patients were randomized into two groups: Xn – patients receiving adjuvant treatment with Xn at a daily dose of 4.5 mg/kg body weight for 7 days, and C – controls. Observations were performed at four time points: immediately after admission to the ICU and on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th days of treatment. The inflammatory response was assessed based on the plasma IL‐6 concentration, neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), C‐reactive protein (CRP) and D‐dimer levels. The mortality rate was determined 28 days after admission to the ICU. Results: Seventy‐two patients were eligible for the study, and 50 were included in the final analysis. The mortality rate was significantly lower and the clinical course was shorter in the Xn group than in the control group (20% vs. 48%, p < 0.05, and 9 ± 3 days vs. 22 ± 8 days, p < 0.001). Treatment with Xn decreased the plasma IL‐6 concentration (p < 0.01), D‐dimer levels (p < 0.05) and NLR (p < 0.01) more significantly than standard treatment alone. Conclusion: Adjuvant therapy with Xn appears to be a promising anti‐inflammatory treatment in COVID‐19 patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: In this prospective observational study n = 108 adult critically ill patients with sepsis of 18-70 years of age were included. Baseline demographic and severity of illness parameters were observed. Transfusion trigger, number of RBCs transfused, and the age of RBCs at transfusion were noted.

Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor days, and requirement of renal replacement therapy. Results: Out of 108 patients, 28-day survival was 72.2% (n = 78) and 90-day survival was 61.1% (n = 66). Median (IQR) transfusion trigger was 6.9(6.7-7.1)g/dl.

Therefore, we studied predictors of a low cortisol response to ACTH. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a general intensive care unit of a university hospital over a three year period. The study included 405 critically ill patients, who underwent a 250 microg ACTH stimulation test because of prolonged hypotension or need for vasopressor/inotropic therapy. Plasma cortisol was measured before and 30 and 60 min after ACTH injection. A low adrenal response was defined as an increase in cortisol of less than 250 nmol/l or a peak cortisol level below 500 nmol/l. Various clinical variables were collected at admission and on the test day. RESULTS: A low ACTH response occurred in 63% of patients. Predictors, in multivariate analysis, included sepsis at admission, low platelets, low pH and bicarbonate, low albumin levels, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and absence of prior cardiac surgery, and these predictors were independent of baseline cortisol and intubation with etomidate. Baseline cortisol/albumin ratios, as an index of free cortisol, were directly related and increases in cortisol/albumin were inversely related to disease severity indicators such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (Spearman r = -0.21; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients, low pH/bicarbonate and platelet count, greater severity of disease and organ failure are predictors of a low adrenocortical response to ACTH, independent of baseline cortisol values and cortisol binding capacity in blood. These findings may help to delineate relative adrenal insufficiency and suggest that adrenocortical suppression occurs as a result of metabolic acidosis and coagulation disturbances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Aims : Assessment of markers including inflammation, endothelial function, and endogenous anticoagulants may provide insight into DIC pathophysiology and lead to improved methods for assessment of patient condition and response to treatment. Methods : Citrated plasma samples were prospectively collected from 102 patients with sepsis and suspected DIC at ICU admission and on days 4 and 8. DIC score was determined using the ISTH scoring algorithm (e.g. platelet count, PT/INR, fibrinogen and D- Dimer). CD 40 Ligand (CD40L), Plasminogen inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), nucleosomes, Procalcitonin (PCT), Microparticle tissue factor (MP- TF) and Prothrombin 1.2 (F1.2) were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. Protein C activity was measured using a clot- based assay. Interleukin 6 (IL- 6), Interleukin 8 (IL- 8), Interleukin 10 (IL- 10), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP- 1) were measured using biochip technology. Results : Significant differences in levels of Protein C (p=0.009), PCT (p=0.0005), IL- 6 (p=0.019), IL- 8 (p=0.0149), PAI- 1 (p=0.015), were observed between survivors and non- survivors. Significant variation of Protein C (p=0.002), nucleosomes (p=0.05), PCT (p< 0.0001), IL- 6 (p=0.001), IL- 8 (p=0.003), IL- 10 (p=0.011), TNFα (p=0.021) and MCP- 1 (p=0.021) were observed based on severity of DIC score. Conclusions : Markers from multiple systems perturbed in DIC were associated with mortality, suggesting that while these systems may not be routinely evaluated in the normal course of patient care, dysfunction of these systems contributes significantly to mortality. In addition, numerous inflammatory cytokines showed an association with DIC score. This suggests that the measurement of additional markers in sepsis- associated DIC may be of value in the prediction of mortality and may be helpful in guiding treatment for these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Using a multidisciplinary case review committee to analyze all cases of SMM at a level IV inner-city hospital, we hypothesized that case reviews will identify opportunities for improvement in obstetric practices. METHODS: A case review was triggered for any delivery with an SMM ICD-10 code, transfusion of greater than 4 units, readmission within 48 hours of discharge, a patient safety concern by staff, or a severe adverse neonatal outcome. This cohort study included all of the case reviews of cases between 2019 and 2022. Severe maternal morbidity outcomes, demographics, and obstetric practices were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 36,671 deliveries, 296 (0.8%) met criteria and were reviewed. Of these, 80 (27%) had two or more concurrent SMM events. Postpartum hemorrhage was the most common (37%), followed by intensive care unit admission (13%) and hysterectomy (12%). After review, practices done well included interdisciplinary communication and prompt decision-making. Opportunities for improvement included inadequate access to peripartum care due to socioeconomic barriers, communication, and lack of role clarity. CONCLUSION: Social barriers, inadequate communication, and lack of role clarity were identified as the most common areas of improvement in SMM cases. These findings led to the development of an escalation of care pathway for massive transfusion protocol and vital signs thresholds at which to contact anesthesia. The implementation of a standardized SMM surveillance system results in systematic improvements in obstetric practices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The conflict between diminishing chances of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing maternal and neonatal morbidity is difficult to quantify, leading to significant variation in management between providers, and variation in rates of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean birth. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop an hourly prediction model for spontaneous vaginal delivery during the second stage of labor in nulliparous women with epidural anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of the Consortium for Safe Labor database. The Consortium for Safe Labor collected data from 228,652 patients at 19 hospitals in the United State from 2002 through 2008. Primary outcome was delivery type per hour of second stage: spontaneous vaginal delivery vs operative delivery (operative vaginal and cesarean delivery). Inclusion criteria were term nulliparas with singleton gestations, vertex presentation, and attainment of 10 cm cervical dilation with epidural anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were intrauterine fetal demise, planned cesarean delivery, and major congenital anomalies. An optimal decision tree was used to create a prediction model. A test set was withheld from the data set to perform validation. A risk calculator tool was developed for prediction of spontaneous vaginal birth as well as adverse perinatal outcomes per hour. Adverse maternal outcomes were a composite of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion, endometritis and third-/fourth-degree laceration. Adverse neonatal outcomes were a composite of neonatal intensive care unit admission, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory distress, seizures, apnea, asphyxia, and shoulder dystocia. RESULTS: The study population included 228,438 deliveries; 26,796 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. After removing cases with incomplete data, the study population consisted of 22,299 women, of which 16,593 women had a spontaneous vaginal delivery (74.4%). The number of deliveries at a given hospital per year, fetal position, cervical dilation on admission, chorioamnionitis, augmentation of labor, maternal age, and length of second stage were associated with the odds of spontaneous vaginal delivery. Using the predictors identified, a risk predictor calculator was created, taking into consideration the length of time in the second stage. A receiver-operator characteristic curve was developed to assess the calculator; area under the curve was 0.73. This calculator is available at https://www.pushprescriber.com/. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous vaginal delivery for women with term, cephalic, singleton gestations with epidural anesthesia was associated with several variables. This calculator tool helps facilitate provider decision making and patient counseling about the value of continuing the second stage of labor based on changing rates of success and risks of maternal and neonatal morbidity with time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α), a tyrosine kinase receptor, was found in previous studies to play a role in orchestrating BBB impairment. In the present study, we investigated the role of PDGFR-α following ICH-induced brain injury in mice, specifically investigating its effect on BBB disruption. METHODS: Brain injury was induced by autologous arterial blood (30 μl) or thrombin (5 U) injection into mice brains. A PDGFR antagonist (Gleevec) or agonist (PDGF-AA) was administered following ICH. PDGF-AA was injected with a thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, in ICH mice. Thrombin-injected mice were given Gleevec or PDGF-AA neutralizing antibody. A p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, SB203580, was delivered with PDGF-AA in naïve animals. Postassessment included neurological function tests, brain edema measurement, Evans blue extravasation, immunoprecipitation, western blot, and immunohistology assay. RESULTS: PDGFR-α suppression prevented neurological deficits, brain edema, and Evans blue extravasation at 24 to 72 hours following ICH. PDGFR-α activation led to BBB impairment and this was reversed by SB203580 in naïve mice. Thrombin inhibition suppressed PDGFR-α activation and exogenous PDGF-AA increased PDGFR-α activation, regardless of thrombin inhibition. Animals receiving a PDGF-AA-neutralizing antibody or Gleevec showed minimized thrombin injection-induced BBB impairment. INTERPRETATION: PDGFR-α signaling may contribute to BBB impairment via p38 MAPK-mediated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation/expression following ICH, and thrombin may be the key upstream orchestrator. The therapeutic interventions targeting the PDGFR-α signaling may be a novel strategy to prevent thrombin-induced BBB impairment following ICH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The trauma triage literature has used a variety of outcome measures to assess appropriate trauma activation. The objective of this study was to determine the agreement between procedural and nonprocedural outcome measures in a population of seriously injured patients transported to a single trauma center. METHODS: Study authors reviewed all ""level 2"" trauma activations (January 2002-December 2003) at an American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level 1 trauma center. ""Level 2"" trauma activations were based on modified ACS Committee on Trauma (COT) triage criteria. Outcomes were classified as nonprocedural (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 15 and intensive care unit [ICU] admission) and procedural (nonorthopedic emergent surgery, emergency chest tube placement, emergency department intubation, emergency department transfusion, or emergent interventional radiology care). RESULTS: Of 479 patients, five were transferred out of hospital. The remaining 474 were predominantly male (62%), with a mean age of 39.7 years. Their average ISS was 13.2. There were nine deaths. For all subjects, 144 (30%) were admitted to the ICU, 172 (36%) had an ISS > 15, 80 (17%) received an emergent procedure, and 46 (10%) went for emergent surgery. Kappas comparing agreement of ISS > 15 with emergent resuscitation and emergent surgery were 0.31 and 0.15, respectively. Kappas comparing ICU admission with emergent resuscitation and emergent surgery were 0.51 and 0.26, respectively.

Methods and Results We screened and included all patients undergoing HTx in our center between September 2010 and December 2022 (n=268) and checked for the occurrence of neurologic events within their index stay. Neurologic events were defined as ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, hypoxic ischemic injury, or acute symptomatic neurologic dysfunction without central nervous system injury. The cohort was then divided into recipients with (n=33) and without (n=235) neurologic events after HTx. Using a multivariable Cox regression model, the association of neurologic events after HTx and survival was assessed. Recipients with neurologic events displayed a longer intensive care unit stay (30 versus 16 days; P=0.009), longer mechanical ventilation (192 versus 48 hours; P<0.001), and higher need for blood transfusion, and need for hemodialysis after HTx was substantially higher (81% versus 55%; P=0.01). Resternotomy (36% versus 26%; P=0.05) and mechanical life support (extracorporeal life support) after HTx (46% versus 24%; P=0.02) were also significantly higher in patients with neurologic events. Covariable-adjusted multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed a significant independent association of neurologic events and increased 30-day (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5 [95% CI, 1.0-6.0]; P=0.049), 1-year (HR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.3]; P=0.019), and overall (HR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5-4.2]; P<0.001) mortality after HTx and reduced Kaplan-Meier survival up to 5 years after HTx (P<0.001).

As a novel marker for inflammatory response, NLR has been proved to be useful for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of inflammatory diseases such as tumor, diabetes, atherosclerosis and other disease. It is well known that inflammatory response plays an important role in the occurrence and development of AKI. Previous studies have shown that NLR has a great value in the diagnosis of AKI, but its value in the prognosis evaluation in AKI patients, especially in critical ill patients with AKI, remains unclear. This study aimed at investigating the predictive value of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on the risk of 90-day mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), so as to provide a simple, feasible, and valuable tool for the prognosis assessment of such patients. METHOD: The data of 802 critically ill patients with AKI admitted to the intensive care unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2015 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the initial NLR level at admission, they were divided into a low NLR group (NLR≤9) and a high NLR group (NLR>9). Differences in comorbidities, the initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil percentage (Neu%), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), lactic acid (Lac), pH, blood glucose (Glu), creatine kinase (CK), and all-cause mortality at 90-day were compared between groups. Binary Logistic regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for 90-day mortality in critically ill patients with AKI, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was computed to evaluate the predictive value of NLR for the risk of 90-day mortality in such patients. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, and Glu between the two groups. The SOFA score, WBC, Hb, Plt, Lac, CK, SC, BUN and NEU%of patients in the high NLR group were higher than those in the low NLR group, while the BMI and pH value was lower in the high NLR group than that in the low NLR group. The 90-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the high NLR group than that in the low NLR group (36.2% vs 16%, P < 0.001). Binary Logistic regression showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality in critically ill patients with AKI (OR=2.402, 95% CI:1.633-3.533,i1=4 °<0.001), even after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, SOFA score, and AKI stages. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of NLR predicting 90-day mortality was 0.613 with a highest prognostic cut-off point of 8. The sensitivity was 65.77%, and the specificity was 54.78%.

As a simple and easily available clinical indicator, NLR could be applied as a valuable tool in guiding the initial treatment of such patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We postulated that the serum albumin nadir (SAN) level would correlate negatively with severity of physiological insult. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included all patients with abdominal trauma admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital during 2017 and 2018. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients, 70 (80.5%) were male. Mean age was 32.48 years (SD 11.65; range 12-73). Blunt trauma comprised 54 patients (62.1%). Median SAN level was 23 g/L (IQR 20-27; range 10-38). Median SAN level was not different between patients with blunt versus penetrating trauma (p = 0.69), patients in whom inotropic support had been used/not used (p = 0.0502), and no different between patients on the various modes of feeding at the time of SAN (p = 0.14). However, median SAN level was lower for patients with hollow visceral injury (p = 0.004), for patients who had undergone laparotomy (p = 0.0006), for those who had received damage control surgery (p = 0.001), those who had received blood transfusions (p = 0.03), and patients who died compared to survivors (p = 0.02). Univariate regression analysis revealed negative coefficients for the following in relation to SAN level: blood transfusion (-2.77; p = 0.023), hollow viscus injury (-3.21; p = 0.008), laparotomy (-4.5; p < 0.001), damage control surgery (-3.60; p = 0.02), day of SAN (-0.39; p = 0.001), ICU length of stay (-0.12; p = 0.002), and death (-3.27; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Greater physiological insults lead to lower levels of SAN. Serum albumin nadir level may therefore have value as a prognostic indicator in the acute trauma setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Long-term follow-up regarding clinical outcome for patients with neonatal hypoglycemia is limited. We report neurological outcome in 24 patients with predominantly occipital lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are typical for patients with neonatal hypoglycemia. Method: The medical records of 24 patients were reviewed retrospectively; all patients had predominantly occipital lesions on MRI with the pattern of abnormality described in the literature. Age of the patients ranged between 1 year and 16 year. Age at the initial evaluation ranged between the first day of life and 15 years. Thirteen of 24 patients had documented hypoglycemia. Apart from 2 patients all patients had prenatal and perinatal problems that made them prone to hypoglycemia and/or medical problems other than hypoglycemia including preterm birth, perinatal hypoxia, intrauterine growth retardation, sepsis, indirect hyperbiluribinemia requiring exchange transfusion and/or phototherapy. One patient was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism of the newborn and one was diagnosed with Von Gierke disease. All patients had mild to moderate developmental delays, and/or behaviour problems to varying degrees. All but 2 patients had symptomatic partial epilepsy, 12 medically intractable. The next most common neurological abnormality was microcephaly diagnosed in seven patients. Other neurological problems included hyperactivity and attention difficulties and autistic features. The majority of patients suffered from visual problems including cortical blindness, optic atrophy strabismus, and problems with visual-spatial learning. Our patients represent late clinical outcome of patients with this particular pattern of abnormality. Conclusion: We emphasize the importance of the early and accurate diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia. Prompt recognition and treatment of symptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia is essential to prevent and minimize the future neurological sequelae.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

CANADA Inc.,,"Purpose of investigation: To report a ten-year experience in management of a highly morbid obstetrical condition in placenta accreta (PA) at a tertiary referral centre, uniquely equipped with an integrated Interventional Radiology theatre, with a primary aim to guide best practice. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of all histologically proven PA cases at a tertiary centre in Australia between January 2004 and December 2013. Medical records were reviewed for obstetrics history, operative details, post-operative management and neonatal outcome. Results: Sixteen cases of PA were identified during the time period; 75% had identifiable risk factors for PA and 87.5% of patients were diagnosed antenatally. Mean gestational age at time of delivery was 34 ± 3.4 weeks. Ten cases were performed electively, while the remaining underwent emergency caesarean section. One patient was managed conservatively with placenta left insitu; time to complete resolution of placenta was 71 days. Among patients who underwent hysterectomy (15/16), the proportion of total (n=8) vs. subtotal (n=7) hysterectomy was similar. Average operating time was 123 ± 45.9 minutes. Compared to emergency cases, patients who underwent elective surgery had significantly lower blood loss (2.2 vs. 3.1 L, p < 0.05). Common iliac artery balloons were deployed in eight cases, with a non-statistically significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss (2 vs. 3.2 L, p < 0.05). Fifty percent of patients required ICU admission. Neonatal survival at six months was 93.75% (15/16). Conclusion: The present report demonstrates the importance of timely diagnosis and comprehensive preparation in the surgical management of patients with placenta accreta. The availability of relevant services in the peri-operative phase, including: obstetricians, interventional radiology facility and personnel, intensive care, and neonatology teams, are crucial in achieving optimal outcome for the patient and neonate. In line with reports in the literature, the authors advocate a team-based multidisciplinary approach in a tertiary-level centre for management of this high-risk condition.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

A case series of retrograde access using ureteroscopic- guided holmium laser in the prone position has recently been described. We present our experience using ureteroscopic- guided retrograde holmium laser in the supine position. Methods: Following computed tomography imaging, informed consent and confirmation of sterile urine, eight procedures in seven patients were performed with flexible ureteroscopic-guided holmium laser nephrostomy access in the modified Valdivia- Galdakao supine position using a 365 lm laser fibre at 1 joule and 10 Hz. Stone clearance was subsequently achieved by combined percutaneous and flexible ureteroscopic means. All patients underwent CT imaging post-operatively. Results: Of the eight procedures, successful retrograde access was obtained in six. One patient who had previously undergone open partial nephrectomy had significant perinephric scar tissue that prevented passage of an anterograde sheath over the laser fibre, and in the other the laser fibre exit site was not identified at the flank. Both patients underwent successful traditional anterograde access, the former using the laser fibre as a guide. The median age was 42 years (range 32-69), BMI 40.8 (range 20.8-48.4) and skin-stone distance 111 mm (range 64-123 mm). The median operating time was 191 min (range 141-330). Four procedures were done for full staghorn calculi and four done for stones ranging from 18 to 34 mm in maximum dimension. No patients required a blood transfusion and there were no cases of injury to surrounding intra-abdominal or thoracic viscera or organs. One patient suffered a 3 cm linear burn to the skin due to an excessive oblique angle created with the laser exiting the skin, requiring excision and primary closure. One patient developed sepsis requiring ICU admission in spite of appropriate pre-operative antimicrobial treatment. Four patients required subsequent procedures to clear residual fragments and two patients required JJ stenting for ureteric stones and a distal ureteric stricture respectively. Conclusions: Ureteroscopic holmium laser-assisted retrograde percutaneous renal access in a modified-supine position, is a technically feasible procedure. With simultaneous endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery, complete staghorn stone clearance can be achieved. Careful patient selection and technique is required to prevent complications. This approach may be added to the armamentarium of techniques used to obtain access to treat often challenging renal calculi cases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This condition demands specialized care and, in some instances, liver transplantation evaluation. No model is available for predicting HE. We aimed to set up and validate a model for predicting the occurrence of HE in paracetamol overdose. METHODS: Prospectively, 161 patients with single-dose paracetamol overdose and no HE (defined as hepatic coma grade II or more) on admission were studied during a 26-month period. Patients admitted during the first 13-month period constituted a learning set to construct a model to predict the occurrence of HE. Patients admitted in the second 13-month period constituted the validation set. Serial biochemical variables (measured twice daily), the time line after the overdose, and demographic data were used for univariate testing, and significant factors were assessed in various multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (20%), 15 in the first period and 17 in the second, developed HE grade II. The best model (the highest chi-square) for HE included: log10 (hours from overdose to antidote treatment), log10 (plasma coagulation factors on admission), and platelet count hours from overdose (chi-square = 41.2, P < 0.00001). In the validation set 88% (confidence interval (CI), 64%-99%) of the patients who developed HE were correctly predicted by the constructed model, whereas 90% (CI, 79%-96%) of the patients in the non-HE group were correctly predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The constructed model for predicting HE in paracetamol overdose proved sensitive and accurate in the validation set and should be valuable for transferring high-risk patients to a liver intensive care unit/transplantation facility.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The spectrum of effects range from pure red blood cell aplasia with hydrops fetalis to meningoencephalitis, with many symptoms in between. Severe anemia in the setting of pure red blood cell aplasia is one of the more common effects that neonatal experience (if infected intrapartum), with the current gold standard treatment being intrauterine or postnatal packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, yet intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be a superior treatment option. Case presentation: A preterm infant was born at 26th week of gestational age via emergency Cesarean section due to hydrops fetalis, with parvovirus B19 exposure one month prior. The infant tested positive for IgM antibodies against parvovirus B19. Among many other serious complications of both hydrops fetalis and premature delivery, the infant had severe unremitting anemia, and received many PRBC transfusion over the course of his 71-day-long neonatal intensive care unit stay. During a follow up appointments as outpatient, his blood tests showed persistent high copies of parvovirus B19. He was then supported with PRBC transfusions and treated with IVIG. After three doses of IVIG, the infant’s parvovirus B19 viral copy numbers have dramatically reduced and the infant did not require any more PRBC transfusions. Conclusions: IVIG infusion effectively treated the parvovirus B19 infection and restored erythropoiesis making the child transfusion independent. Furthermore, since IVIG is safe and readily crosses the placenta, further studies are needed to determine if IVIG should be considered as an alternative prenatal treatment for congenital parvovirus B19 infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Although the exact etiology remains uncertain, vessel fragility with external factors is believed to have led to submucosal bleeding and hematoma formation; the vessel was ruptured by a sudden increase in pressure due to nausea, and the hematoma was enlarged by antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Serious conditions are rare, with a better prognosis. We present the first known case of submucosal esophageal hematoma-subsequent hemorrhagic shock due to Mallory-Weiss syndrome. CASE SUMMARY A 73-year-old female underwent endovascular treatment for an unruptured cerebral aneurysm. The patient received aspirin and clopidogrel before surgery and heparin during surgery, and was well during the surgery. Several hours after returning to the ICU, she complained of chest discomfort, vomited 500 mL of fresh blood, and entered hemorrhagic shock. Esophageal submucosal hematoma with Mallory-Weiss syndrome was diagnosed through an endoscopic examination and computed tomography. In addition to a massive fluid and erythrocyte transfusion, we performed a temporary compression for hemostasis with a Sengstaken-Blakemore (S-B) tube. Afterwards, she became hemodynamically stable. On postoperative day 1, we performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and confirmed no expansion of the hematoma nor any recurring bleeding; therefore, we removed the S-B tube and clipped the gastric mucosal laceration at the esophagogastric junction. We started oral intake on postoperative day 10. The patient made steady progress, and was discharged on postoperative day 33. CONCLUSION We present the first known case of submucosal esophageal hematoma subsequent hemorrhagic shock due to Mallory-Weiss syndrome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Here we present a detailed review of paediatric admissions with the pattern of injury and the resources they consume. Methods: All paediatric admissions to the hospital at Camp Bastion between 1 January and 29 April 2011 were analysed prospectively. Data collected included time and date of admission, patient age and weight, mechanism of injury, extent of wounding, treatment, length of hospital stay and discharge destination. Results: Eighty-five children (65 boys and 17 girls, median age: 8 years, median weight: 20kg) were admitted. In 63% of cases the indication for admission was battle related trauma and in 31% non-battle trauma. Of the blast injuries, 51% were due to improvised explosive devices. Non-battle emergencies were mainly due to domestic burns (46%) and road traffic accidents (29%). The most affected anatomical area was the extremities (44% of injuries). Over 30% of patients had critical injuries. Operative intervention was required in 74% of cases. The median time to theatre for all patients was 52 minutes; 3 patients with critical injuries went straight to theatre in a median of 7 minutes. A blood transfusion was required in 27 patients; 6 patients needed a massive transfusion. Computed tomography was performed on 62% of all trauma admissions and 40% of patients went to the intensive care unit. The mean length of stay was 2 days (range: 1-26 days) and there were 7 deaths. Conclusions: Paediatric admissions make up a small but significant part of admissions to the hospital at Camp Bastion. The proportion of serious injuries is very high in comparison with admissions to a UK paediatric emergency department. The concentration of major injuries means that lessons learnt in terms of teamwork, the speed of transfer to theatre and massive transfusion protocols could be applied to UK paediatric practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial occlusion have all been increasingly reported and investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have however focused on the occurrence of bilateral acral ischemia (BAI). The aim of our study was to examine the characteristics of COVID-19 patients who developed BAI, as well as the various therapy options that might be offered to them. Patients and methods/Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study including patients admitted to our intensive-care unit for acute respiratory distress (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between January and August 2021. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and vasopressive treatment doses were recorded and used to compare between patients who developed BAI and those who did not. Fischer bilateral exact test and Mann-Whitney-u test were used for comparison between groups. Results: During the study period, 398 patients were admitted; 238 male and 160 female. Of these patients, 8 developed BAI (7 men). Mean age was 67 years old. Medical history of diabetes was present in 7 patients, and hypertension in all 8 patients. All patients who developed BAI had severe ARDS. Only one patient remained on non-invasive ventilation support at the time of BAI occurrence and until discharge. The main affected sites of BAI were fingers and toes although ear lobules were also involved in 3 patients. The mean time to development of BAI starting from the day of admission was 4.9 days. Among patients who were intubated, the mean time of BAI occurrence after intubation was 1.2 days. 4 patients were not under any vasopressive treatment at the time of BAI development. The mean norepinephrine dose among the other 4 patients was 0.65 mg/h. When compared to the other group of patients, there was no statistically significant difference in gender (p = 0.12), median age (56 vs 67 years old; p = 0.054), baseline prothrombin time levels (p = 0.08), d-Dimer levels (p = 0.13), platelet count (p = 0.22) and blood fibrinogen levels (p = 0.061) when available. Survival rates between the two groups were not statistically significant (196 vs 1 patient; p = 0.068). Anticoagulant treatment using heparin was given to 4 patients, with only one patient improved over the course of 10 days.

The ASH recommends using the “4 T's Score” to estimate the probability of HIT. If the 4 T's score reflects an increased probability of HIT (score ≥4), the guidelines recommend laboratory testing for heparin antibodies with confirmatory serotonin release assay, discontinuation of heparin products and initiation of a nonheparin anticoagulant. An alternative pre-test probability score known as CPB was developed for determining probability of HIT in patients after CABG surgery. Our study aims to assess if heparin antibody testing is being performed in accordance with current guideline recommendations. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective chart review conducted from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2020. Patients were included if they were ≥18 years old, admitted by the cardiac ICU or cardiac surgery service and had heparin-PF4 antibody tests ordered. We collected demographics data, heparin-PF4 and SRA results, platelet trends, mechanical support devices utilized, and cardiopulmonary bypass data to retrospectively calculate 4 T's scores and CPB scores for all applicable patients and determine if laboratory tests were sent appropriately. Additionally, we collected data on alternate anticoagulant use during suspected HIT. RESULTS: We observed that 78.7% of patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass, and 45.4% of patients had cardiac devices present. Heparin-PF4 tests were positive in 27 (25%) patients, and HIT was confirmed with a positive SRA in 10 (9.3%) patients. Based on calculated 4 T's scores, 21 (19.4%) tests were sent appropriately based on current guideline recommendations. We also observed that 80% of patients with confirmed HIT had a 4 T's score ≥4. According to retrospectively calculated CPB scores, 68.2% of heparin- PF4 tests were sent in accordance with guidelines, and 100% of patients with confirmed HIT had a CPB score ≥2. When HIT was suspected, heparin was stopped in 55.6% of patients, and alternate anticoagulation was given to 25% of these patients. CONCLUSION: We found that 81.6% of heparin antibody tests were sent inappropriately based on 4 T's scores and 31.8% of heparin antibody tests were sent inappropriately based on CPB scores.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In patients with uncontrolled bleeding from unresectable gastric cancer, palliative radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to be an effective means to achieve hemostasis with reported bleeding control rates ranging from 53 to 80%. Case Description/Methods: 74-year-old female presented with abdominal pain for several days. She also had intermittent melena for several weeks. She was recently diagnosed with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma with extensive liver metastases. Initial blood tests revealed critical anemia with hemoglobin at 5.3 g/dL. She was emergently transfused several units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and admitted to the critical care unit. Intravenous infusions of proton-pump inhibitor was also started. A few days prior she had a G-tube placed because of continued melena with eating which was attributed to her primary gastric cancer lesion located in the gastric cardia. Her hemoglobin level stabilized and tube feeding was resumed. Her gastric bleeding recurred soon afterwards and several additional units of blood transfusion had to be given. Multiple attempts to reinstate tube feeding, including switching to bolus method, were unsuccessful as she developed recurrent bleeding on stomach irritation. To control her bleeding, palliative radiotherapy was initiated for her gastric lesion. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was also introduced while tube feeding was placed on hold. She achieved partial hemostasis after several days of palliative radiation and her abdominal pain also improved. Discussion: For patients with metastatic gastric cancer, several therapeutic options exist to control symptoms of local disease progression such as bleeding, pain, or obstruction, including palliative surgical resection, radiation therapy, surgical bypass, and endoscopic techniques. Among those, radiotherapy is usually well-tolerated and often preferred for local palliation as it provides high response rates and longer term tumor control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DESIGN: Retrospective record review comparing 2 transplant centers, one using the low CVP method and the other using the normal CVP method. SETTING: University-based, academic, tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing orthotopic cadaveric liver transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: Each center practiced according to its own standard of care. Center 1 maintained an intraoperative CVP <5 mmHg using fluid restriction, nitroglycerin, forced diuresis, and morphine. If pressors were required to maintain systolic arterial pressure >90 mmHg, phenylephrine or norepinephrine was used. At center 2, CVP was kept 7 to 10 mmHg and mean arterial pressure >75 mmHg with minimal use of vasoactive drugs. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Data collected included United Network for Organ Sharing status, surgical technique, intraoperative transfusion rate, preoperative and peak postoperative creatinine, time spent in intensive care unit and hospital, incidence of death, and postoperative need for hemodialysis. Principal findings include an increased rate of transfusion in the normal CVP group but increased rates of postoperative renal failure (elevated creatinine and more frequent need for dialysis) and 30-day mortality in the low CVP group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite success in lowering blood transfusion requirements in liver resection patients, a low CVP should be avoided in patients undergoing liver transplantation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Results: Out of 126 patients, 74 (58.7 %) developed AKI and 13 (10%) required RRT after transplant. Independent predictors of AKI are shown to be factors associated with surgical procedures such as graft ischemic time as were previous cardiac operation, administered Voluven (starch) dose > 400 ml, and transfusion of more than four blood units.

Up to date, the clinical characteristics of diabetes patients with COVID-19 and the risk factors for poor clinical outcomes are not clearly understood. Methods: The study was retrospectively carried out on enrolled diabetes patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection from a designated medical center for COVID-19 from January 25th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The medical record was collected and reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with the severe events which were defined as a composite endpoint of admission to intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: A total of 52 diabetes patients with COVID-19 were finally included in the study. 21 (40.4%) patients had developed severe events in 27.50 (IQR 12.25–35.75) days follow-up, 15 (28.8%) patients experienced life-threatening complications and 8 patients died with a recorded mortality rate of 15.4%. Only 13 patients (41.9%) were in optimal glycemic control with HbA1c value of <7.0%. In addition to general clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the severe events diabetes patients showed higher counts of white blood cells and neutrophil, lower lymphocytes (40, 76.9%), high levels of hs-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (PCT) as compared to the non-severe diabetes patients. Mild higher level of cardiac troponin I (cTNI) (32.0 pg/ml; IQR 16.80–55.00) and D-dimer (1.70 μg/L, IQR 0.70–2.40) were found in diabetes patients with severe events as compared to the non-severe patients (cTNI:20.00 pg/ml, IQR5.38–30.00, p = 0.019; D-dimer: 0.70 μg/L, IQR 0.30–2.40, p = 0.037). After adjusting age and sex, increased level of cTNI was found to significantly associate with the incidence of severe events (HR: 1.007; 95% CI: 1.000–1.013; p = 0.048), Furthermore, using of α-glucosidase inhibitors was found to be the potential protectant for severe events (HR: 0.227; 95% CI: 0.057–0.904; p = 0.035). Conclusion: Diabetes patients with COVID-19 showed poor clinical outcomes. Vigorous monitoring of cTNI should be recommended for the diabetes patients with COVID-19. Usage of α-glucosidase inhibitors could be a potential protectant for the diabetes patients with COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: Between November 2003 and November 2015, 483 consecutive patients underwent RADCAB surgery. They were divided into two groups. Group 1 (147 patients; mean ± SD age, 61.2 ± 11 years; 23% females) underwent robotic‐assisted hybrid coronary artery revascularization with left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery with percutaneous coronary intervention to a nonleft anterior descending coronary artery vessel in the same stage. Group 2 (336 patients; mean ± SD age, 61.2 ± 10.5 years; 25% females) underwent nonhybrid RADCAB. Early and late postoperative follow‐up at mean ± SD of 83.6 ± 11.1 months was obtained. Results: Blood transfusion rate in group 1 was statistically different, as illustrated in Table 2. Based on the intraoperative cardiac catheterization, the incidence of graft revision was higher in the nonhybrid group. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of renal failure, neurological complication, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and gastrointestinal bleed. Conclusions: Despite similar preoperative demographics in the two groups, we have observed a significant difference in the blood transfusion rate in group 1. However, this did not lead into a statistically significant re‐exploration rate for bleeding. Hence, we assume that dual antiplatelet therapy usage in the hybrid group might be the cause of the increase in blood transfusion rate. Nevertheless, it did not affect postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay. A randomized multicenter clinical trial is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The most common causes of hemolysis are ABO/Rh incompatibility and enzyme deficiencies such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), and galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Our patient was a male infant, weighing 3,160 g, at 38 þ 4 gestational week; he was referred to our unit with total bilirubin level of 14.7 mg/dL recorded at the postnatal 20th hour and was initiated treatment with intensive phototherapy and prepared for exchange transfusion. The G6PD, PK, and GALT enzyme levels studied at the postnatal 96th hour and reducing substances in urine were detected to be normal/negative, whereas complete urinalysis revealed pyuria (7 leukocytes per each high power field). α-hemolysis-producing 105 colony-forming unit/mL Enterobacter cloacae grew on blood agar in the urine culture.

This early coagulopathy is associated with increased transfusion requirement, prolonged intensive care unit stay, and a 4-fold increase in mortality compared with noncoagulopathic patients. Despite remarkable advances in knowledge, the etiology of traumainduced coagulopathy (TIC) is still not fully understood. Traditionally, TIC has been assumed as a combination of Bexogenous[ factors, such as consumption of coagulation proteins in particular fibrinogen, dilution of the remaining coagulation factors, and depletion of coagulation factors secondary to blood loss. Dysfunction of the remaining coagulation factors caused by hypothermia and acidosis is presumed to additionally contribute to TIC. Importantly, recent studies investigating prehospital trauma patients revealed that TIC starts immediately after major injury independently of the previously mentioned reasons. Current concepts suggest an Bendogenous[ mechanism primarily driven by shock-associated hypoperfusion in combination with tissue trauma, which activates the protein C pathway. This results in anticoagulation, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperfibrinolysis, and platelet dysfunction. In the course of hypotensive low-flow states, significant amounts of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) are released from endothelial cells and thrombomodulin is expressed on their surface. Thrombomodulin binds thrombin and subsequently activates the protein C pathway. Protein C, together with its cofactor protein S, slows down the accelerators of the coagulation process by inactivating FVIIIa and FVa. Furthermore, high amounts of protein C consume plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI 1), the major antagonist of t-PA. As a consequence, overwhelming amounts of t-PA are available, creating a profibrinolytic state. Hyperfibrinolysis results in a destruction of the fibrin network, thus decreasing clot stability. In addition, degradation of fibrinogen leads to defibrination. Less is known about platelet function after major trauma. Recently, it has been shown that platelet aggregation by ADP and TRAP as activator was significantly lower in nonsurvivors compared with survivors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Results: A 28 year-old male with no medicalhistorywasadmitted to the emergency room for severe abdominal pain evolving for 3 days. On examination he was a febrile with marked pallor, scleralicterus, abdominal distension and diffuse epigastric tenderness associated with splenomegaly. Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia with severe regenerative normocyticanemia. Serum bilirubin was increased with predominant indirect bilirubin component associated to elevated Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Direct antiglobulin test was negative. A computerized tomography (CT) scan wasperformedshowing acute right and left portal vein thrombosis. PNH was suspected confirmed with flow cytometry. Anticoagulation therapy using low molecular weight heparin was started associated with folic acid and blood transfusion. Treatment with monoclonal antibody Eculizumab could not be used because of its non availability. A slight improvement was initially noted with relief of his abdominal pain and decrease of LDH but few days later he presented a sub-occlusive syndrome with dyspnea and acute hemolysis. He was admitted than in the intensive care unit where he dead because of massive pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: PNH is a rare acquired hematologic disorder with various clinical manifestations.

Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Consortium on Safe Labor that included women with term (37 weeks of gestation or greater) singleton gestations and a history of one prior cesarean delivery who attempted TOLAC. Induction of labor was compared with expectant management by week of gestation from 37 to 40 weeks in both high- and low-risk cohorts. The primary outcome was failed TOLAC. Secondary outcomes included composite maternal morbidity (hysterectomy, transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, venous thromboembolism, death), composite neonatal morbidity (5-minute Apgar score less than 5, cord pH less than 7.0, asphyxia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, neonatal death), and neonatal ICU admission. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounding factors. Results: We identified 6,033 women attempting TOLAC of whom 1,626 (27.0%) underwent induction of labor and 4,407 (73.0%) did not. Compared with expectant management, induction was associated with an increased risk of failed TOLAC at 37-39 weeks of gestation but not at 40 weeks of gestation (37 weeks of gestation, 48.5% compared with 34.3%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.28]; 38 weeks of gestation, 47.0% compared with 33.0%, adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29-2.34; 39 weeks of gestation, 45.6% compared with 29.8%, adjusted OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.76-2.67; 40 weeks of gestation, 37.9% compared with 29.4%, adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90-1.66). Induction was associated with an increased risk of composite maternal morbidity at 39 weeks of gestation (adjusted OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.22-2.87) and neonatal ICU admission at 37 weeks of gestation (adjusted OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.62-3.90).

Conclusion: Induction of labor in women with one prior cesarean delivery, compared with expectant management, is associated with an increased risk of failed TOLAC.

Compared with conventional mitral surgery (full sternotomy approach) and after overcoming initial learning curve, it turns out to be a safe and effective technique, with equivalent short‐ and long‐term follow‐up results. Despite involving an increase in operative times (ischemic and cardiopulmonary bypass time), the MIMVS is associated with shorter in‐hospital and intensive care unit stay, reduced blood loss and transfusions, earlier extubation and fewer arrhythmias and allows a faster patient recovery with better cosmetic result. Therefore, MIMVS is a steadily growing technique in different centers, being recommended prospective randomized studies that allow a better assessment of clinical outcomes and in terms of cost‐efficiency.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The comparison included: intraoperative time parameters, postoperative complications, intensive care unit and hospital stays, postoperative echocardiography, and in-hospital mortality rate. Patients and methods: Between September 2013 and August 2015 a total number of 41 patients, who underwent mitral and tricuspid valve operations (mitral valve replacement with or without tricuspid valve repair) in Cairo University as well as one of the ministry of health hospitals were included in this study. Of these patients: 19 cases were operated upon via inverted L shaped partial lower sternotomy (Group I) and 22 cases received conventional sternotomy (Group II). Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of cross clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time; however the total procedure time was in favor of the conventional approach. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the amount of chest tube drainage, and the need for blood transfusion which was lower in the ministernotomy group. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the ventilation time in favor of the ministernotomy group. The study showed no statistically significant difference in mortality rate between the two groups. Conclusion: Ministernotomy approach for mitral and tricuspid valve surgery is a safe and feasible technique. This technique provides many advantages such as smaller incision with traditional exposure and familiar instruments, decreased amount of postoperative bleeding, need for blood transfusion and decreased duration of ventilation time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of OHT patients at Tufts Medical Center from May 2013 to October 2016. SETTING: Single-institution, university hospital setting. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with preexisting LVADs who received orthotopic heart transplants (n = 74; 32 patients 4F-PCC, 42 patients no 4F-PCC). INTERVENTIONS: Warfarin reversal using 4F-PCC in patients with LVADs undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation with the 4F-PCC dosing partitioned such that one-third was given pre-CPB and two-thirds were given post-CPB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 4F-PCC group required less plasma (6 [IQR 4] v 1.31 [IQR 2] U, p < 0.001), cryoprecipitate (10 [IQR 10] v 7.50 [IQR 5] U, p < 0.001), and packed red blood cells (5 [IQR 4] v 2 [IQR 1.5] U, p < 0.001) and had a shorter time to chest closure (618.8 ± 111.4 v 547.9 ± 110.1 minutes, p = 0.008). There was no difference in platelet transfusion (2 [IQR 1] v 2 [IQR 1] U, p = 0.16), ICU or hospital LOS, acute kidney injury, or mortality. No thrombotic complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing plasma with 4F-PCC to reverse preoperative warfarin anticoagulation during OHT was associated with a shorter time to chest closure and less blood product utilization, without an increase in acute kidney injury, thromboembolic complications, or death.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The clinical efficacy, mechanical ventilation time, duration of ICU stay, respiratory mechanics, hemodynamics, inflammatory mediators and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Results: Compared with the control group, the total effective treatment rate in the research group was higher, and the mechanical ventilation time and duration of ICU stay were shorter (P<0.05).

There were no adverse events (AEs), she was discharged home but 1.5 hours later she returned with fever (103°F), rigors, dyspnea, cough, chest pressure, nausea, diarrhea, and dark urine. Hypotension and tachycardia developed; she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Study Design/Methods: Posttransfusion blood and urine samples were obtained. The platelet (PLT) bag had been discarded. Serial dilutions (with saline diluent) from the five donor testing tubes and a simulated PLT pool were performed, read at immediate spin (IS) and IgG (1 h at 37°C incubation). Results/Findings: Testing confirmed an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR): elevated lactate dehydrogenase (996 U/L, 135-225 U/L), undetectable haptoglobin (<10 mg/dL, 30-200 mg/dL), prolonged PT (18.3 sec, 10.2-12.9), international normalized ratio (1.5, 0.8-1.1), activate partial thromboplastin time (47.3 sec, 25.1-36.5), no evidence of infection on blood or urine cultures and urinalysis showed dark amber urine with large blood on dipstick but only zero to two RBCs/high-powered field. Pretransfusion hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL fell to 7.5 g/dL upon admission; PLT count of 5000/μL increased to 27,000/μL. She developed acidosis, lactate (7.0 mmol/L, 0.5-2.0 mmol/L). Her hemoglobinuria cleared and she required extensive support before discharge home. This was the second AHTR due to PLTs in 32 years of this hospital's operation with 12,195 PLT transfusions in 2018. The first event in 1997 occurred with apheresis PLTs. Both events occurred in smaller-sized recipients. At 37°C the simulated pool and Donor 5 had high-titer anti-A. The donor was permanently deferred (Table). Conclusions: ABO-mismatched PLT transfusions result in good increments and the majority are free of significant adverse events (AEs). Physicians must be aware of the potential risk of AHTR when PLTs are transfused and that posttransfusion fever ± chills is typically benign but should be rapidly investigated to rule out more serious AEs. PLT-associated AHTR has occurred with apheresis PLTs but is very rare with WBD PLTs. These two events could have been prevented by restricting ABOincompatible plasma volumes in smaller-sized adults (via PLT concentration or use of PLT additive solution), donor anti-A titer screening, or avoiding Group O PLTs to non-O recipients.

Results: Data for 415 deceased donor transplant recipients were collected, 47 patients were excluded. Of the remaining 368 patients, 157 (42.7%) were FTE. A binomial regression model to generate a FTE propensity score was produced. Each additional APACHE II point and each unit of intraoperative blood transfusion reduced the likelihood of FTE by 9.6% and 17.7% respectively. Patients arriving in ICU during normal working hours were 2.6-fold more likely to be FTE. 216 patients, 108 in each cohort, were matched within 5% of their FTE propensity scores. A reduction in AKI stage 1 on postoperative day 1 and post-op RRT was observed in the FTE group vs non-FTE group (23.4% vs 36.4%, p=0.037 and 16.3% vs 7.5%, p=0.046 respectively). Vasopressor support and ICU stay was also significantly reduced in the FTE group vs non-FTE group (1 vs 2 days, p<0.001 and 3 vs 4 days, p<0.001 respectively). Conclusions: FTE benefits both patients and institutions by reducing the requirements for organ support and length of ICU stay for patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Nearly all venomous snakes in Turkey are members of the Viperidae family and show poisonous local and hematotoxic effects. METHODS: A total of 77 children (mean age 9.9 +/- 2.9 years; age range 3-14 years) with venomous snakebites were investigated. General characteristics of the children, species of the snakes, localization of the bite, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment approaches, complications and prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 1.4. Ninety-one per cent of cases were from rural areas. Most of the bites were seen in May and June. Mean duration between snakebites and admissions to our department was 13 +/- 6.5 h. According to a clinical grading score, 57.1% of patients presented to us as grade II. Mean leukocyte count, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase and protrombin time levels were above the normal ranges and mean activated partial tromboplastin time was below the normal range. Platelet counts inversely correlated with the grading score and duration of hospitalization. The most common complication that occurred during the treatment was tissue necrosis (13%). The mean hospital stay time was 6.3 +/- 6 days. Three children with disseminated intravascular coagulation died. Fasciotomies were performed to seven (9.1%) children due to compartment syndrome. Of 10 children with tissue necrosis, three (3.9%) had finger amputation and seven (9.1%) had toe amputation. Higher grading score on admission, platelet count below 120 000/mm3, AST over 50 IU/L and existence of evident ecchymosis were found as significant risk factors for development of serious complications by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Snakebite poisoning is an emergency medical condition that is particularly important in childhood. The envenomations are still considerable public health problems with a high morbidity and mortality in rural areas of Turkey.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We aimed to investigate GPVI in patients presenting with symptoms of acute cerebrovascular disease and to define GPVI as biomarker for acute stroke. Methods: We consecutively evaluated 205 patients, who admitted the stroke unit with symptoms for stroke. Surface expression of the platelet activation markers (GPVI, CD62P, GPIb) was determined by two-color whole blood flow cytometry. Results: Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) (n=18;8.8%) as well as with stroke (n=133;64.9%) showed a significantly enhanced GPVI expression (mean fluorescence intensity±SD) on admission compared to patients with nonischemic (NI) events (n=54;26.3%) (TIA: 20.9±7.1 vs.NI: 16.2±3.9;p=0.002; stroke: 20.4±5.7 vs.NI;p=0.002). Neither CD62P nor GPIb surface expression showed a significant difference. Logistic regression analysis revealed that on admission GPVI was associated with stroke independent of conventional laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein, blood glucose, and creatine kinase. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve on GPVI, we have determined the cut off value of 18.2 for stroke. Thus, patients with enhanced GPVI expression levels (≥18.2) had a 2.4 fold relative risk for stroke. Patients with elevated platelet GPVI expression level had a poorer clinical outcome in cumulative event-free survival for stroke, myocardial infarction, and cerebro-/cardiovascular death at threemonth follow-up (Log rank;p=0.045). Conclusions: These findings indicate that platelet GPVI surface expression is significantly enhanced in patients with TIA and stroke compared to patients with NI events. Determination of platelet-specific GPVI may be useful as an early biomarker for cerebral ischemia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

It can be associated with other cranial nerve palsies while injury to this nerve typically affects a patient's articulation by causing lingual motility disturbance and swallowing difficulty. Bilateral isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy is an even more infrequent condition, which can occasionally be due to airway manipulation. Case presentation: We describe a case of bilateral hypoglossal nerve damage following general anesthesia for emergency surgery, presenting with dysarthria, immobility of the tongue and dysphagia after extubation. The patient had a gradual recovery of all lost functions during the next four months. Clinical discussion: Bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy is a very rare entity and tracheal tube malposition or prolonged but unnoticed tracheal cuff pressure especially in the face of low blood pressure, should be considered as possible causative mechanisms for this condition. This underlines the importance of careful positioning of the patient's head and neck during surgery as well as the meticulous and correct performance of routine maneuvers of airway management. Conclusion: Bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy is a very rare entity. Diagnosis and management of twelfth nerve palsy require a multidisciplinary approach to achieve the best patient outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The patients were divided into three groups (BMI < 25, BMI 25-35, BMI > 35 kg/m(2)) for illustrative purposes. Demographic and perioperative outcome data were compared. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). Thirty-eight patients underwent robotic hepatectomy, 73% were women, age was 58 (57 ± 17.6) years, and ASA class was 3 (3 ± 0.5). Indications for surgery were neoplastic lesions in 34 patients (89%), hemangioma in two patients (6%), fibrous mass in one patient (2.5%), and focal nodular hyperplasia in one patient (2.5%). 32% of the patients underwent right or left hemihepatectomy, 21% underwent sectionectomy, 5% underwent central hepatectomy and the reminder underwent non-anatomical liver resection. Operative time was 261 (254.6 ± 94.3) min. Estimated blood loss was 175 (276 ± 294.8) ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 (5 ± 4.9) days. By regression analysis of the three BMI groups, estimated blood loss, rate of postoperative complication, rate of conversion, need for transfusion, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay did not have a significant relationship with BMI. A total of five patients (13%) experience complications. Four patients had complications that were nonspecific to liver resection, including acute renal injury, respiratory failure, and enterocutaneous fistula. One patient had bile leak, treated with ERCP stenting. No mortality was seen in this study. Obesity should not dissuade surgeons from utilizing minimally invasive robotic approach for liver resection. Robotic technique is a safe and feasible in patients with high BMI. The impact of BMI on outcomes is insignificant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Complementary tests: laboratory investigations revealed highlights a total bilirubin of 50.7 mg/dL (0.2-1.2) predominantly unconjugated, normal blood count and negative direct Coombs. Given the severity of the values, he was diagnosed with extreme hyperbilirubinemia and was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The patient underwent exchange transfusion and intensive phototherapy, measures that allowed bilirubin levels to decrease to 19.27mg/dL. Etiological study: a metabolic study was conducted: organic acids in urine were normal, pyruvate kinase in erythrocytes: 137.3mU/1000m (60-220) and G6PD: 49.3 mU/1000m (221-557). Considering these findings, a genetic study for G6PD deficiency was requested, finding the c.563C>T variant in hemizygosis in the G6P gene, corresponding to the type 2 or Mediterranean variant, predominant in some regions of Asia such as India. CONCLUSIONS Most cases of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are due to physiological causes, but there are specific cases where etiological diagnosis is essential, especially in extreme cases such as the one presented. Given the high prevalence of G6PD deficiency, it should be taken into account as a possible cause. The clinical manifestations depend on the degree of enzyme deficiency and can range from jaundice to chronic hemolytic anemias. Early diagnosis is essential and will allow the patient to be educated to avoid triggering factors that cause hemolytic crises and their consequences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Endotheliopathy and activation of both platelets and coagulation predict critical illness and death. For these reasons the use of anti-platelet agents and increased-intensity anticoagulation in the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is under intense study in several clinical trials. We sought to examine the impact of aspirin and anticoagulation on hospitalization outcomes. Methods: We examined outcomes in a large multi-site cohort of consecutive, hospitalized, COVID-19 laboratory confirmed patients under a risk-stratified treatment algorithm from March 13 through June 18, with a focus on efficacy of aspirin and/or increased-intensity anticoagulation. Out of 4150 identified hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we created 3 study cohorts. The overall cohort (2785 patients) excluded pediatric patients, those with incomplete electronic data, and those with multiple admissions. The aspirin (1956 patients) and anticoagulation (1623 patients) cohorts were nested within the overall cohort; the former excluded patients on any home anti-platelet therapy or those who received non-aspirin anti-platelet therapy in the hospital, while the latter excluded patients who did not receive prophylactic or intermediate dose anticoagulation in the hospital. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes were time-to-death with a competing risk (time-to-hospital-discharge), escalation to ICU, length-of-stay and use of mechanical ventilation. Variables examined included age, gender, BMI, race, Rothman Index (RI), D-dimer (DD) and patient co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and prior VTE. The aspirin and anticoagulation cohorts underwent propensity score (PS) matching utilizing variables found to be significant in multivariable regression modeling in the overall cohort with 638 and 386 patients, respectively. Results: Univariate followed by multivariable regression modeling in the 2785 patient overall cohort established a novel role for RI, and independent roles for age, BMI, and maximum DD, in predicting severity of illness. In all cohorts the 50th and lower percentile of admission RI was predictive of mortality in multivariable modeling (i.e. aspirin: 3rd and 4th admission RI quartiles with HR = 0.18 for both, p<0.001 for both). In PS matched patients, aspirin was associated with a significant decrease in mortality (OR 0.65 [0.42, 0.98], p=0.044) and a significant increase in mechanical ventilation (OR 1.49 [1.03, 2.18], p=0.037) and ICU status (OR = 1.45 [1.06, 1.98], p=0.021). In PS matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort, intermediate versus prophylactic dose anticoagulation was associated with a marginal decrease in mortality (OR 0.60, p=0.053). In the aspirin cohort examining in-hospital death and discharge as competing risks, the use of aspirin was associated with decreased mortality (p=0.042) and had no effect on discharge (p=0.31). In the anticoagulation cohort a similar competing risk model showed the use of intermediate rather than prophylactic anticoagulation decreased mortality (p=0.046) and had no effect on discharge (p = 0.21). Conclusion: We show in a large cohort of consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated under a risk-stratified algorithm the prognostic utility of the admission RI in assessing outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a potential benefit of aspirin therapy on in-hospital death from COVID-19. A potential albeit marginal benefit of intermediate dose anticoagulation over prophylactic dose anticoagulation merits further study with results of clinical trials awaited.

A large proportion of them exhibit a systemic inflammatory response causing anemia of chronic disease. Although tumor factors play an essential role in determining the prognosis, studies have also reported the role of host factors in the outcome. This study was done to determine the association between systemic inflammation, tumor characteristics, and immediate postoperative outcome among various anemia subgroups. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective observational study of patients undergoing treatment for GI cancers. The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) was calculated, and patients were followed up until discharge regarding postoperative complications, length of the hospital, ICU stay, and mortality. The patient demographics, tumor characteristics, systemic inflammation, and postoperative complications were studied among different subtypes of anemia. Results: A total of 209 patients were analyzed, and a higher prevalence of normocytic anemia (52.63%) and systemic inflammatory response (62.21%) was observed among the study population. Systemic inflammation was significantly associated with a higher nodal stage (p = 0.02) and margin positivity (p = 0.006). Patients with higher mGPS had significantly higher requirements for blood transfusion (p = 0.003), superficial SSI (p = 0.03), and sepsis (p = 0.02); however, other postoperative complications were comparable among patients without an inflammatory response. Conclusion: Higher prevalence of normocytic anemia is observed among patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Normocytic anemia is significantly associated with systemic inflammation with no significant difference in tumor characters and immediate postoperative outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The patient was in shock status on arrival to the hospital. Circular collapse progressed rapidly during contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning. CT images revealed exacerbation of the right lateral deviation of the heart that was earlier seen on X-ray imaging. Considering cardiac herniation based on CT findings, we immediately performed resuscitative thoracotomy and clamshell thoracotomy at the emergency department. Intraoperative findings showed a pericardial defect, and the heart had deviated to the right thoracic cavity. Immediate repositioning revealed a marked improvement in circulation. Full-thickness cardiac injury was observed in the anterior wall of the left ventricle; no active bleeding was observed. We performed temporary thoracic wall closure after cardiorraphy for damage control. After admission to the intensive care unit, he presented with respiratory failure associated with pulmonary contusion. Therefore, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V–V ECMO) was used from the 2nd to the 5th hospital day. After confirming no intra-thoracic events on the 6th hospital day, chest wall closure was performed. The patient subsequently developed heart failure and mitral regurgitation associated with papillary muscle rupture. On the 62nd hospital day, he underwent mitral annuloplasty at the cardiovascular surgery division; After rehabilitation till 152nd hospital day, he was discharged without any neurological abnormality. This was an extremely rare case with concomitant full-thickness myocardial injury, intracardiac injury, and cardiac herniation. Rapid resuscitative thoracotomy and damage control including V–V ECMO yielded good results. Retrospectively, cardiac herniation should have been suspected earlier basis this observation. Our report highlights that cardiac herniation should be considered in case of cardiac shadow aberrations in cases of blunt chest trauma, familiarity with condition and its characteristic imaging findings are critical for the doctor overseeing initial trauma treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We discuss the role of the neonatal nurse in prevention of ROP based on a framework of five dimensions of care: specialist knowledge, clinical advocacy, leadership and mentorship, service management and counselling. Developing the role in the prevention of ROP needs to be supported by a wider movement to develop core training competencies and national benchmarks for neonatal nurses.

We aimed to determine if an admixture of ketamine and propofol for emergent endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients was superior to etomidate. Primary endpoint was the change in mean arterial pressure from baseline to 5 minutes postdrug administration. METHODS Emergent-use, stratified (shock status and unit type), multiunit, randomized, parallel-group superiority clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center. Adult medical/surgical and transplant/oncologic intensive care unit patients undergoing emergent intubation were assigned randomly to receive either ketamine/propofol admixture (0.5 mg/kg of ketamine and propofol each) or reduced dose etomidate (0.15 mg/kg) for emergent intubation. RESULTS One hundred sixty participants were randomized, and 152 (79 ketamine/propofol admixture, 73 etomidate) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in mean arterial pressure change from baseline to 5 minutes postdrug administration (treatment difference [ketamine/propofol admixture - etomidate]: -2.1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -6.9 mm Hg to +2.7 mm Hg; p = 0.385). In addition, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the change of mean arterial pressure from baseline at 10 minutes and 15 minutes postdrug administration, no statistical difference in the use of new-onset vasoactive agents or difficulty of intubation between groups. More patients in the etomidate group required non-red blood cell transfusions (16 [22%] vs. 8 [10%], p = 0.046). For patients who had adrenal testing performed, more patients in the etomidate group developed immediate adrenal insufficiency (13 [81%] of 16 vs. 5 [38%] of 13, p = 0.027). Serious adverse events were rare, 2 (3%) (cardiac arrest, hypotension) in ketamine/propofol admixture and 4 (5%) (hypertension, hypotension) in etomidate (p = 0.430). CONCLUSION In a heterogeneous critically ill population, ketamine/propofol admixture was not superior to a reduced dose of etomidate at preserving per-intubation hemodynamics and appears to be a safe alternative induction agent in the critically ill.

Institutional variability was observed in the frequency of intraoperative RBC transfusion rates, which ranged from 0% to 85.7%. The institution mean RBC transfusion rate was 40.8%. Regional geographic and cardiac program size variations were observed in RBC transfusion rates and volume with significant variation.

DESIGN: The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Model for Improvement provided a structure for this performance improvement project. Outcome evaluation was further supported by the Kirkpatrick model. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: Reports of rising maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States prompted action within a multisite health system. Maternity care teams were determined to proactively support excellence in practice through enhancements to continuing education. PARTICIPANTS: Maternity providers and nurses practicing within the organization completed the training. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: Online, assessment-driven learning modules for maternity emergencies were blended with existing instructor-led courses, simulation, and Team Strategies to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) training in early 2017. In addition, a postpartum hemorrhage safety bundle was implemented. Outcome measures included rates of hemorrhage, massive transfusion, and intensive care unit admission for women admitted for childbirth. Outcome measures were tracked using retrospective chart review with baseline period October 1, 2016, through March 31, 2017, and performance period April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2018. RESULTS: Improvements in perinatal outcomes were observed. The average rate of hemorrhage decreased by 3% (from 56.4/1,000 to 54.7/1,000). Median massive transfusion rates decreased by 35% (from 2.3/1,000 to 1.5/1,000). Similarly, the median rate of maternal intensive care unit admissions decreased by 77% (from 3.1/1,000 to 0.7/1,000). A downward shift was supported with zero intensive care unit admissions for 6 of the last 7 months (n = 4,422 pregnant women or women who experienced birth during the current admission). CONCLUSION: Excellence in the management of postpartum hemorrhage was supported through a multipronged approach that included the use of an online e-learning platform for maternity emergencies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

One of the most common issues with neonatal sepsis is thrombocytopenia, which is also one of the most reliable independent risk factors for sepsis-related mortality. The purpose of the current study was to figure out the incidence of thrombocytopenia in newborn sepsis and to assess if it might be used as a screening test for the condition. Materials and methods: The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at a tertiary care hospital hosted this hospital-based prospective observational cross sectional study from July 2022 to December 2022. In total, 220 neonates who were hospitalized to the NICU with suspected sepsis before turning 28 days old were included in the study. Results: A total of 220 newborns with clinical sepsis were admitted during the research period. There included 73 (33.18%) female neonates and 147 (66.82%) male neonates. In 56 (25.4%) patients, the blood culture proved positive. The most prevalent Gram positive and Gram negative organisms were Kleibsella species 13 (23.21%) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (CONS) 23 (41.07%). 101 births (45.91%) by caesarean section and 119 (54.09%) by normal vaginal delivery were recorded. 43 neonates (19.55%) had low birth weights, while 177 had normal birth weights (>2.5 kg). SGA made up 33 (15%), AGA made up 183 (83.18%), while LGA made up 4 (1.82%). Preterm births made up 42 (19.09%), term births made up 168 (76.36%), while postterm births made up 10 (4.55%) cases. CRP was positive in 123 instances (55.91%) and negative in 97 cases (44.09%). Among the total cases, 89 (40. 45%) had thrombocytopenia, in which mild was 53 (24.09%), moderate was 28 (12.73%), severe was 8 (3.64%). Thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with Blood culture positivity, LSCS, SGA and CRP positivity. (P<0.05) Conclusion: Thrombocytopenia acts as an early predictor of neonatal sepsis and also the outcome of the neonates. Platelet counts and clinical correlation can be used in conjunction to detect early sepsis and administer prompt, effective care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Study Design: The study analyzed 15.4 million births in the US from 2016-2019 using natality data provided by the CDC. Data from 2020-2021 was not included in the analysis to eliminate confounding factors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals using SPSS© for ICU admission, CD, and maternal transfusion across different races. Results: When accounting for CD history, the number of previous CDs, gestational and pre-pregnancy hypertension, gestational and pre-pregnancy diabetes, unplanned hysterectomy, and a ruptured uterus, maternal race remained a statistically significant risk factor for ICU admission (p < 0.001) in the multivariate analysis. After normalizing to White race, Asian and Black populations had aORs of 1.478 and 1.501 for ICU admission, respectively. While Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island (NHOPI) and American Indian and Native American (AINA) mothers had the highest aORs of 2.612 and 1.501, they represented a small of births in the US (Table 1, Table 2). Accounting for previous CDs, the number of previous CDs, and BMI, the multivariate analysis of CD and maternal race demonstrated that the Asian population had a higher aOR of 1.304 relative to the White population. In addition, Black race has an aOR of 1.211 for maternal transfusion and AINA and NHOPI have aORs of 2.714 and 1.624, respectively (Table 2). Conclusion: The study’s findings suggest that maternal race may impact the risk of ICU admission, CD, and maternal transfusion. Notably, Black, Asian, NHOPI, and AINA populations are particularly at increased risk for ICU admission.

In July 2015, the protocol changed to a reduced postoperative infusion time of 4 hours. A retrospective review was conducted of records of 30 patients who had surgery before the protocol change (24-hour group) and 23 patients whose surgery occurred after the protocol change (4-hour group). The following data were collected: blood volume transfused, hemoglobin levels, estimated blood loss, and intensive care days; and costs of TXA and blood transfusion. Results showed a 4-hour infusion was as effective as a 24-hour infusion for reducing blood loss in patients undergoing craniosynostosis. Transfusion requirements, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and estimated blood loss were not significantly different for the groups. The cost of TXA and transfusion in the 4-hour group was significantly less (P < 0.001) than in the 24-hour group. No significant difference in cost existed for patients who received blood transfusion alone versus patients who received the 4-hour TXA infusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most common reason for re-hospitalization in AML as current algorithms call for rapid administration of IV antimicrobials and close monitoring. Whether this approach is justified in all situations is unclear given availability of novel oral broad-spectrum antimicrobials and home drug infusion services. While FN risk models have been developed focusing on solid tumors, factors predicting uncomplicated courses of FN in AML patients, which might allow the identification of patients suitable for outpatient management, have not been studied. Objective: To identify factors to that define a low-risk population of AML patients admitted for FN. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records for adults admitted for FN (temperature ≥38.3°C and absolute neutrophil count <1,000 cells/μL) following intensive AML chemotherapy. Outcomes included culture/radiographic documentation of infection, hospitalization length, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, type/duration of antimicrobials administered, and survival. “Low-risk” outcome was assumed if patients were discharged within 72 hours without requiring ICU care. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression mixed-effects models (accounting for patients with >1 admission) assessed covariate associations with discharge. Results: We identified 250 FN admissions in 129 AML patients from 7/29/14–6/26/19. Thirty-three (13%) admissions were <3 days. Patients with shorter admissions were more likely to have had a prior transplant but otherwise the two cohorts did not differ in other factors evaluated including: age, transfusion within 24 hours, previous fungal infection, cardiac/pulmonary comorbidities, albumin levels or blood pressure on presentation. Patients with longer admissions were more likely to have an infection identified (60% vs 36%; p=0.013) but there were no differences in 30-day mortality. No single factor predicted an uncomplicated admission in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, we developed a model to predict shorter admissions—including the above factors—with an AUC of 0.76. Conclusions: Only 13% of AML admissions for FN were short and uncomplicated. Factors that predicted more severe outcomes in solid malignancies did not individually predict such outcomes for AML patients; however, a model of combined risk factors resulted in a moderate-high predictive ability for a “low-risk” admission.

In both groups, platelets were transfused to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 100 × 109 /L.

Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 are important regulators of endothelial cell function, and the ratio of plasma angiopoietin-2-to-1 is a useful indicator of overall vascular health. We therefore characterized plasma angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios over time after trauma in adults in an effort to gain insight into the pathophysiology that may drive post-traumatic vasculopathy and organ injury. We performed a single-center prospective observational study to measure plasma angiopoietin-1 and -2 levels and determine angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios in adult trauma patients upon hospital arrival and after 12, 24, and 48h. Compared with levels in healthy adults, angiopoietin-1 levels were significantly elevated at hospital arrival, and angiopoietin-2 levels were significantly elevated at 12, 24, and 48h. These kinetics translated in angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios that were significantly greater than controls at 24 and 48h. After regression analysis, elevated angiopoietin-2 levels were independently associated with blunt injuries at admission, with coagulopathy at admission and 12h, and with hemorrhagic shock at 24 and 48h. Significant correlations were observed between both angiopoietins and 24-h transfusion requirements. Angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios correlated with mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay. In this study, we demonstrate novel temporal associations between angiopoietin dysregulation and blunt injuries, acute coagulopathy, and hemorrhagic shock. Moreover, our findings highlight the presence of endothelial activation following traumatic insults in adults that may contribute to worse clinical outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Valproic acid (VPA) administration in high doses (300-400 mg/kg) improves survival in lethal trauma models, but effectiveness of lower doses on survival is unknown. This information is essential for properly designing the upcoming clinical trials. We, therefore, performed the current study to determine the lowest dose at which VPA administration improves survival in a model of lethal injuries. METHODS: Swine were subjected to traumatic brain injury (10-mm cortical impact), 40% blood volume hemorrhage, and multiple trauma (femur fracture, rectus crush, and Grade V liver laceration). After 1 hour of shock, animals were randomized (n = 6/group) to four groups: normal saline (NS) resuscitation; or NS with VPA doses of 150 mg/kg (VPA 150) or 100 mg/kg (VPA 100) administered over 3 hours or 100 mg/kg over 2 hours (VPA 100 over 2 hours). Three hours after shock, packed red blood cells were given, and animals were monitored for another 4 hours. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. RESULTS: Without resuscitation, all of the injured animals died within 5 hours. Similar survival rates were observed in the NS (17%) and VPA 100 (0%) resuscitation groups. Survival rates in the 100-mg/kg VPA groups were significantly (p < 0.05) better when it was given over 2 hours (67%) compared to 3 hours (0%). 83% of the animals in the VPA 150 group survived, which was significantly higher than the NS and VPA 100 over 3 hours groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A single dose of VPA (150 mg/kg) significantly improves survival in an otherwise lethal model of multiple injuries. This is a much lower dose than previously shown to have a survival benefit and matches the dose that is tolerated by healthy human subjects with minimal adverse effects.

TAL has been documented in ICU patients following nonleukoreduced red blood cell transfusions, while association with leukoreduced (LR) blood is less clear. Here we describe an atypical case of TAL amid a dyspneic transfusion reaction to pRBC in a 64-y-old man with refractory myeloma, raising the concern of LR failure. Study Design/Methods: A blood bank investigation was initiated after a respiratory reaction to a unit of 11-d-stor, ABO-matched, irradiated pRBCs marked by a 600% increase in WBC count. Morphological assessment, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, and 10-color multi-parameter flow cytometry were performed to further elucidate the nature of the leukocytosis and to address potential donor vs. recipient origin. Results/ Findings: This patient's baseline (G-CSF refractory) WBC count spiked from 0.5 × 109 cells/L to 3.4 × 109 cells/L, performed at the time of reaction. The majority of this rise was accounted for by a 10-fold increase in lymphocytes from 0.3 × 109 cells/L to 2.9 × 109 cells/L. Platelets were unchanged. Remarkably, the WBC count returned to pretransfusion levels 2 h thereafter, while the patient was still symptomatic. Morphological examination confirmed a relative increase in lymphocytes, many of which had features of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). By CD45 and side scatter, 78% of live events were in the lymphocyte gate and 15% granulocytes. Unexpectedly, the lymphocytosis was T-cell-biased, with 94% of the lymphocytes CD3+, and of those 93% expressed CD8. The remaining lymphocytes were NK cells (CD56+). No CD19+ B cells were detectable. STR analysis revealed a nonchimeric signature between the RBC product and posttransfusion CBC. Clinically, the patient's respiratory status improved after noninvasive positive pressure oxygenation in the ICU with aggressive diuresis. Conclusion: In the midst of a dyspneic transfusion reaction, a fleeting leukocytosis was captured in an otherwise chronically leukopenic patient. Due to the concern that part of the WBC rise may have been product-derived, molecular and flow cytometric investigations were pursued. In contrast to the published granulocytic composition of TAL, we instead observed a lymphocytosis composed almost entirely of CD8+ T cells with LGL morphology. This, along with nonmatching STR profiles, argued against LR failure and instead suggested more of an atypical inflammatory response likely related to the patient's myeloma.

The differences may be in part due to racial characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is an increase in obstetric and neonatal complications, especially postpartum hemorrhage, in pregnant women with epilepsy in the Turkish population. Methods: In a tertiary center, PWWE and the control group were compared in terms of obstetric and neonatal complications as well as postpartum hemorrhage. Among 46,789 deliveries, 154 eligible PWWE were matched 1: 3 with the control group. Results: There was no increase in the possibility of peripartum hemorrhage and blood transfusion in PWWE. However, the probability of cesarean delivery was higher in PWWE (adjusted OR: 3.24 CI: 1.95–5.42, p < 0.001). Moreover, an increase in the possibility of fetal growth restriction, fetal death, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and lower APGAR scores were found in PWWE. Conclusion: Although the risk of peripartum hemorrhage does not appear to be increased in PWWE, cesarean rates and fetal complications do increase. There is also a need for prospective studies examining long-term neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by epilepsy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of erythropoietin and 2 hemoglobin transfusion thresholds (7 and 10 g/dL) on neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial of 200 patients (erythropoietin, n = 102; placebo, n = 98) with closed head injury who were unable to follow commands and were enrolled within 6 hours of injury at neurosurgical intensive care units in 2 US level I trauma centers between May 2006 and August 2012. The study used a factorial design to test whether erythropoietin would fail to improve favorable outcomes by 20% and whether a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of greater than 10 g/dL would increase favorable outcomes without increasing complications. Erythropoietin or placebo was initially dosed daily for 3 days and then weekly for 2 more weeks (n = 74) and then the 24- and 48-hour doses were stopped for the remainder of the patients (n = 126). There were 99 patients assigned to a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 101 patients assigned to 10 g/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous erythropoietin (500 IU/kg per dose) or saline. Transfusion threshold maintained with packed red blood cells. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale score dichotomized as favorable (good recovery and moderate disability) or unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative, or dead) at 6 months postinjury. RESULTS: There was no interaction between erythropoietin and hemoglobin transfusion threshold. Compared with placebo (favorable outcome rate: 34/89 [38.2%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 49.1%]), both erythropoietin groups were futile (first dosing regimen: 17/35 [48.6%; 95% CI, 31.4% to 66.0%], P = .13; second dosing regimen: 17/57 [29.8%; 95% CI, 18.4% to 43.4%], P < .001). Favorable outcome rates were 37/87 (42.5%) for the hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 31/94 (33.0%) for 10 g/dL (95% CI for the difference, -0.06 to 0.25, P = .28). There was a higher incidence of thromboembolic events for the transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL (22/101 [21.8%] vs 8/99 [8.1%] for the threshold of 7 g/dL, odds ratio, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79], P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with closed head injury, neither the administration of erythropoietin nor maintaining hemoglobin concentration of greater than 10 g/dL resulted in improved neurological outcome at 6 months. The transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. These findings do not support either approach in this setting.

The aim of current study was evaluating the effects of early anticoagulant treatment in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. METHOD: The present retrospective and comparative cohort study investigated 413 hospitalized Covid-19 patients treated with or without Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) (n = 187 and 226, respectively) in the Covid Clinics of Gulhane Education and Research Hospital in Ankara, Turkey, between March 18 and May 03, 2020. The treatment groups were consisted of the patients evaluated before and after The Covid-19 Treatment Guide update on April 12, 2020 that included the anticoagulant treatment thereafter. RESULTS: The mean age of all 413 patients (204 male and 209 female) at disease onset was 50.6 ± 16.7 years. The LMWH-treated patients had significantly higher coagulation markers such as d-dimer and platelet count than LMWH-untreated patients (p values < 0.05). The inflammatory markers, ferritin, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin were significantly increased in LMWH-untreated patients (p values < 0.05). The presence of any comorbidity was significantly more common in LMWH-treated patients compared to LMWH-untreated group (39.6% vs 19.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities in both groups. The number of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and longer length of hospital stay were more commonly observed in LMWH-untreated patients (p values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early anticoagulant treatment with relatively higher doses of LMWH may improve the clinical outcome of Covid-19 patients and shorten the length of hospital stay.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

No studies advocating staged HKT identify hemodynamic endpoints or other criteria that optimize timing for successful kidney transplantation. We aim to determine if surgical sequence impacts hemodynamic conditions at the time of reperfusion of the renal allograft (Trr), and if staged HKT allows for hemodynamic stabilization before kidney transplantation. Methods A retrospective review was performed for all HKT (September 2008-May 2017) comparing hemodynamic, inotropic, and transfusion data between staged and simultaneous. Mean arterial pressure and inotrope score (IS) determined conditions at Trr. Staged HKT ICU data trends defined clinical course between operations. Results 18 HKT were reviewed (Tables). Staged had higher IS at Trr, longer KCIT, and increased delayed graft function of renal allograft (DGFr). Staged had increased IS between operations with no significant requirement for transfusion or renal replacement therapy. DGFr (n=6) was associated with higher IS at Trr (19 +/-11.4 vs 12 +/-9.2) and longer KCIT (1026 +/-318 min vs 855 +/-301). Discussion Our findings show no significant difference in hemodynamic conditions at Trr or evidence of hemodynamic stabilization between operations for staged. Timing is based on subjective clinical impression, surgeon preference, or other factors rather than clearly defined hemodynamic criteria that both minimize KCIT and optimize conditions at Trr. Further research to understand the impact of surgical strategy is warranted to optimize resource utilization and outcomes for both allografts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including 675 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The incidence of allogeneic blood transfusions and clinical postoperative complications were analyzed before and after ROTEM® implementation. RESULTS: Following viscoelastic testing and the implementation of a specific algorithm for coagulation management, the incidence of any allogeneic blood transfusion decreased (41.4% vs 31.9%, p=0.026) during the perioperative period. In the group monitored with ROTEM®, decreased incidence of transfusion was observed for packed red blood cells (31.3% vs 19.8%, p=0.002), fresh frozen plasma (9.8% vs 3.8%, p=0.008), prothrombin complex concentrate administration (0.9% vs 0.3%, p=0.599) and activated recombinant factor VII (0.3% vs 0.0%, p=0.603). In addition, statistically significant reductions were detected in the incidence of postoperative bleeding (9.5% vs 5.3%, p=0.037), surgical reexploration (6.0% vs 2.9%, p=0.035), and length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (6.0 days vs 5.3 days, p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of hemostasis by ROTEM® in cardiac surgery, was associated with decreased incidence of allogeneic blood transfusion, clinical hematologic postoperative complications and lengths of ICU stay. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Finally, the data of this retrospective study have shown that implementation of the ROTEM® system, together with a specific algorithm to interpret its results, was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of any blood product transfusion, as well as decreased incidence of postoperative bleeding, unplanned reexploration and lengths of ICU stay.

Five days later he was found to have acute drop in platelet count from 389,000/UL to less than 5.000/UL the next day. Only symptom being epistaxis. Peripheral smear did not show platelet clumping or schistocytes. There was evidence of toxic granulation, decreased lymphocytes and no platelets were visible. Bone marrow suppression was unlikely due to the acute drop. ADAMTS 13, Direct Coombs test, triglyceride, ferritin, HPF4, vitamin B12 and folate and tick borne antibody screen was negative. A immune related event was suspected at this point due to the acuteness. Platelets were transfused with no improvement in post transfusion platelet counts. Post transfusion purpura was considered and human platelet antigen genotyping and antibody testing was sent out. Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 6 h was started along with IVIG treatment. There was no improvement in his thrombocytopenia. After 2 days plasmapheresis was started on a daily basis, this showed a gradual improvement in his platelet counts to 70,000/UL in 3 days time. His tests confirmed anti-HPA-1a antibody. He was later transferred on to hospice care due to his encephalopathy and other comorbidities and finally died. DISCUSSION: Post Transfusion purpura is a form of severe thrombocytopenia occuring after transfusion of blood products. It is usually seen in individuals with HPA negative platelets, most often seen in multiparous women who have been immunized with HPA positive pregnancy. It can also be seen in men 5-10 days after transfusion with a sudden decrease in platelet count. It is seen in the form of an ananmestic response with the formation of HPA antibodies which react with the individuals own platelets which are HPA negative. The mechanism of this still remains unclear, a number of subtypes of HPA have been reported in the past. Our patient had no history of transfusion in the past or any history of thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis is based on the identification of the antibody in the serum of a patient who lacks the corresponding antigen, anti-HPA-1a being the most common, these tests may take days to weeks. Therapy should not be delayed. Platelet transfusion is generally not helpful in the management of this condition as the platelet count drops further even with platelet transfusions. The treatment of Post Transfusion Purpura is steroids, IVIG, exchange transfusion and sometimes plasma pheresis. Our patient was refractory to steroids and IVIG, and responded well to the plasmapheresis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A retrospective study with historical control was conducted. The treatment group consisted of 52 mechanically ventilated adult patients, with a diagnosis of ILI as confirmed by bronchoscopy, admitted to burn intensive care unit (BICU) from the year 2006 to 2009. The group was treated with nebulised heparin, NAC and salbutamol. The control group consists of 11 mechanically ventilated ILI patients who were treated in BICU from year 2001 to 2005 before the initiation of the protocol. Blood coagulation indices (consisting of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and platelet count) were monitored and bleeding incidences were assessed. Results: Blood coagulation indices based on the APTT, PT and platelet counts did not suggest an increase risk of bleeding with nebulised heparin. The APTT, PT and platelet count followed a similar trend for both groups over 7 days. No clinically significant increase in bleeding risk was found to be associated with nebulised heparin.

We recently reported that leucine-rich repeat-containing 16A (LRRC16A) modulates baseline platelet counts to mediate ARDS risk. OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of LRRC16A in ARDS survival and its mediating effect through platelets. METHODS: A total of 414 cases with ARDS from intensive care units (ICUs) were recruited who had exome-wide genotyping data, detailed platelet counts, and follow-up data during ICU hospitalization. Association of LRRC16A single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ARDS prognosis, and the mediating effect of SNPs through platelet counts were analyzed. LRRC16A mRNA expression levels for 39 cases with ARDS were also evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Missense SNP rs9358856G>A within LRRC16A was associated with favorable survival within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.87; P = 0.0084) and 60 days (P = 0.0021) after ICU admission. Patients with ARDS who carried the variant genotype versus the wild-type genotype showed an attenuated platelet count decline (∆PLT) within 28 days (difference of ∆PLT, -27.8; P = 0.025) after ICU admission. Patients with ∆PLT were associated with favorable ARDS outcomes. Mediation analysis indicated that the SNP prognostic effect was mediated through ∆PLT within 28 days (28-day survival: HR(Indirect), 0.937; 95% CI, 0.918-0.957; P = 0.0009, 11.53% effects mediated; 60-day survival: HR(Indirect), 0.919; 95% CI, 0.901-0.936; P = 0.0001, 14.35% effects mediated). Functional exploration suggested that this SNP reduced LRRC16A expression at ICU admission, which was associated with a lesser ∆PLT during ICU hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: LRRC16A appears to mediate ∆PLT after ICU admission to affect the prognosis in patients with ARDS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

SGLT2 inhibitors are second-line therapy, touting improved cardiovascular mortality and offering kidney protection. SGLT2 inhibitors have also been found to increase the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eDKA). We present a patient with life-long obesity and type 2 DM, managed on multiple oral antihyperglycemic medications and high doses of insulin who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy complicated by eDKA which we believe resulted in coagulopathy and contributed to postoperative bleeding. Our patient was a 44-year-old male on metformin, insulin (120U QD), glipizide, and ertugliflozin. He halved his glargine for 2 days prior to the operation and stopped all oral DM medications on the day of surgery. His sleeve gastrectomy was uncomplicated. Late on POD#0, he became tachycardic. Stat labs showed stable hemoglobin, anion gap 24, beta hydroxybutyrate>5, bicarbonate 17, and glucose 159; he was in eDKA. He was admitted to the ICU, started on an insulin drip, resuscitated and his acidosis resolved. His tachycardia persisted, so CTAP was obtained demonstrating hemoperitoneum, for which he returned to the operating room for hematoma evacuation around the staple line. No active bleeding was seen. Acidosis has been shown to impair platelet aggregation, increasing fibrinogen breakdown and impair the coagulation cascade. There is a well-documented association between DKA and gastrointestinal bleeding. We hypothesize that DKA may also contribute to postoperative hemorrhage; however, other such scenarios have yet to be documented. Well documented in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, eDKA is characterized by serum bicarbonate level<18 mEq/L, pH<7.3, anion gap>12 mEq/L, elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration, blood glucose<250 mg/dL. While most oral DM medication should be held on the day of surgery, SGLT2 inhibitors should be held 4 days prior to surgery, per FDA 2022 recommendations. In bariatric patients, it may be advantageous to hold the SGLT2 inhibitors four days prior to starting pre-operative liquid diet. EDKA typically occurs after a physical stressor such as surgery or fasting. Its presentation is similar to that of postoperative complications with symptoms of abdominal pain, tachycardia, and nausea, making accurate and timely diagnosis difficult. Bariatric surgeons need to be aware of eDKA and how to manage SGLT2 inhibitors preoperatively.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This is achieved, in part, by ensuring adequate cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery and so it seems physiologically rational to transfuse packed red blood cells (PRBCs) when TBI patients are anemic. However, there are several lines of evidence that suggest that transfusion of PRBCs in critically ill patients may be harmful. Thus, there is a diverse opinion on the benefits and thresholds for transfusion in TBI and an urgent need to understand the neurophysiologic effects. This study aims to provide objective, non-invasively achieved, physiologically relevant data in order to provide some rational basis for decision-making for transfusion in TBI patients. Methods We have prospectively enrolled five TBI patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU who, at the discretion of the treating physician, reached a threshold for transfusion of PRBCs. We evaluated the applicability of four-wavelength near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor the cerebral tissue oxygenation (StO2) in TBI patients during a transfusion of PRBCs. We present the preliminary results testing the hypothesis that the transfusion of PRBCs will improve oxygen delivery and will be associated with improved StO2 values. Results Five patients were measured over a 24-hour period. StO2 values strongly correlated with values obtained from the contralateral side (p <0.01). StO2 values increased after a transfusion but this did not reach statistically significance in all patients. Conclusions These preliminary results outline a novel procedure to evaluate the cerebral tissue oxygenation in traumatic brain injured patients during a blood transfusion. The results illustrate to what degree cerebral tissue oxygenation is dependent on the degree of anemia and its correction. The results did not reach statistical significance for all patients, this may be due to a lack of cerebral autoregulation, increasing global brain dysfunction or storage lesions in PRBCs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Since one unit of RBCs contains 220 mg of iron and 25% of the RBCs are cleared by macrophages within 1 hour following transfusion, RBC transfusion could increase iron levels and iron availability for erythropoiesis. We investigated the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism in ICU patients, and additionally compared the effect in septic patients to non-septic patients. Study Design/Method: In a prospective cohort study in 52 ICU patients who received one RBC transfusion, different iron parameters were measured before and 24 hours after transfusion, to determine the effect of a RBC transfusion over a period of time. Next, the impact of a RBC transfusion on plasma iron parameters in septic patients compared to that in non-septic patients was analyzed. Plasma iron concentration, transferrin (saturation), ferritin, haptoglobin, hepcidin and IL-6 levels were determined. Results/Finding: In this cohort, serum iron levels were low and did not change following transfusion (4.1 vs. 4.3 mmol/L, p=0.69). Also, the transfusion had no effect on transferrin saturation (12 vs. 13 %, p=0.13), ferritin (531.0 vs. 599.0 mg/L, p=0.74) and IL-6 levels (35.0 vs. 25.5 pg/ml, p=0.09). Hepcidin levels increased in these ICU patients after RBC transfusion (223 vs 332 ng/ml, p=0.01). In septic patients, RBC transfusion induced a decrease in haptoglobin levels compared to baseline, which did not occur in non-septic patients (-2.7 vs. 3.7 % change, p=0.05). Other iron parameters did not differ between septic and non-septic patients. Conclusion: Transfusion of one unit of RBCs does not increase iron levels in ICU patients. The increase of hepcidin suggests RBC transfusion induced upregulation of hepcidin, despite the absence of a significant increase in IL- 6 or plasma iron levels. This increase in hepcidin levels after transfusion can potentially further hamper iron availability for erythropoiesis. In sepsis, RBC transfusion decreases haptoglobin levels, suggestive of hemolysis. In conclusion, RBC transfusion might have a negative effect on erythropoiesis, due to the increase in hepcidin levels that are observed after transfusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

All newly admitted patients were included if they stayed in the ICU for more than 48 hr and did not have thrombocytopenia upon admission. A total of 186 patients were included. NOT developed in 37.1%. Most common cause of NOT was sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (66.7%), followed by drug-induced thrombocytopenia (18.8%), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (2.9%). IgG-specific antibody to platelet factor 4/heparin was positive in 2.4% among patients treated with heparin, and thrombosis occurred in two patients. Twenty eight-day mortality was higher in patients that developed NOT compared to those that did not develop NOT (39.1% vs 12%, P < 0.001). NOT increased the odds ratio of 28-day mortality and was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.32-9.38; P = 0.012). In conclusion, NOT is common and is an independent risk factor for mortality in Korean ICU patients.

CRI is derived from the pulse oximetry waveform and reflects the proportion of physiologic reserve remaining before clinical hemodynamic decompensation. Methods: In this prospective, observational, prehospital cohort study, we measured CRI in injured patients transported by emergency medical services (EMS) to a single Level I trauma center. We determined whether the rolling average of CRI values over 60 s (CRI trend [CRI-T]) predicts in-hospital diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock, defined as blood product administration in the prehospital setting or within 4 h of hospital arrival. We hypothesized that lower CRI-T values would be associated with an increased likelihood of hemorrhagic shock and better predict hemorrhagic shock than prehospital vital signs. Results: Prehospital CRI was collected on 696 adult trauma patients, 21% of whom met our definition of hemorrhagic shock. The minimum CRI-T was 0.14 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.08-0.31) in those with hemorrhagic shock and 0.31 (IQR 0.15-0.50) in those without (P = <0.0001). The positive likelihood ratio of a CRI-T value <0.2 predicting hemorrhagic shock was 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-2.22). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the minimum CRI-T predicting hemorrhagic shock was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.60-0.70), which outperformed initial prehospital HR (0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.62) but underperformed EMS systolic blood pressure and shock index (0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79 and 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67-0.77, respectively). Conclusions: Low prehospital CRI-T predicts blood product transfusion by EMS or within 4 hours of hospital arrival but is less prognostic than EMS blood pressure or shock index. The evaluated version of CRI may be useful in an austere setting at identifying injured patients that require the most significant medical resources. CRI may be improved with noise filtering to attenuate the effects of vibration and patient movement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval of 509 ms. The patient subsequently underwent CI. Here, we outline the challenges anticipated and the precautions to be taken when performing implantation on a patient with JLNS.

Prophylactic in-vivo T-Cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has recently been reported as leading to decreased GVHD rates in matched unrelated and related donor HSCT, without increases in relapse or death. Understanding that higher rates of GVHD are observed with matched unrelated versus matched related donor HSCT, we have always had a local policy to give ATG as part of GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing HSCT from an unrelated donor. Here we report and compare clinical outcomes of patients who did and did not receive ATG at our transplant center using a unique, substantially lower ATG dose than previously reported. Methods We conducted a retrospective single-center database study comparing outcomes in 110 matched unrelated donor (MUD; ATG-exposed) and 78 matched related donor (MRD; ATG-unexposed) HSCT patients transplanted for any malignant indication at The Ottawa Hospital from 2009 to 2014. Patients were exposed to a rabbit ATG formulation (Thymoglobulin ®) at 0.5 mg/kg on day -2 and 2.0 mg/kg on day -1 prior to stem cell infusion, to total 2.5 mg/kg. Primary outcomes assessed were incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, defined as new-onset GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy at less or more than 100 days post HSCT, respectively. Secondary outcomes included disease relapse and survival. Results At baseline there were no significant differences in median age at transplant, sex, disease indication or risk index, graft source, conditioning regimen and intensity between ATG exposed (MUD) and unexposed (MRD) cohorts. The majority of patients in both cohorts had intermediate or high disease risk index. There were significant baseline differences between the ATG exposed and unexposed cohorts with respect to proportion of 7/8 mismatched unrelated donor transplants (14 v 6% respectively, p = 0.015) and median CD34+ dose (4.9 v 7.6 x 108 cells; p < 0.001). No differences were noted in platelet engraftment. ATG exposed patients had significantly shorter time to neutrophil engraftment than the unexposed cohort (16 v 19 days respectively; p=0.007). ATG exposed patients had significantly lower rates of GVHD compared to the unexposed cohort (57 v 79%; p=0.005), with differences noted predominantly in rates of chronic GVHD (18 v 44%, p= 0.009). The proportion of patients off immune suppression one year after HSCT was not significantly different between the cohorts.At median follow-up of 13 (1-73) months for the ATG exposed cohort and 20 (0- 69) months for the ATG unexposed cohort, no significant differences in overall survival (median overall survival not met for either cohort), cumulative incidence of relapse (26 v 29%; p=0.73) or relapse-free survival (not met in ATG exposed; 26.2 months in ATG unexposed, p=0.22) were observed between groups (Figure 1). Significant differences were observed with respect to GVHD-Free Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS) between ATG exposed and unexposed cohorts, with a two-year GRFS of 23 v 3% respectively (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences between cohorts in proportion of patients with post HSCT infectious episodes or ICU admissions. Conclusions Here we report significantly lower rates of chronic GVHD and significant improvement in GVHD-free relapse-free survival in our ATG exposed MUD HSCT cohort compared to our ATG unexposed MRD. These findings were observed without differences in relapse or survival outcomes, infectious complications or ICU admissions. While in keeping with other recent reports on ATG use for GVHD prophylaxis, our findings indicate that a lower dose of ATG may be effective in preventing GVHD. Our study suggests that a broader exploration into the optimal dosing of this prophylactic GVHD agent is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Blood transfusion administration undergoes a strict protocol in our nursery. RESULTS: During the 3 week study period, the hemoglobin and hematocrit remained similar in the 2 groups while the reticulocyte counts were greater in the recombinant human erythropoietin recipients on day 14. The number and volume of blood transfusions were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Very low birth weight infants receive fewer blood transfusions than the number previously reported.

Both the side effects and disease course after treatment with CPT have not been thoroughly investigated. CPT is primarily reserved for those participating in FDA approved clinical trials, however this case highlights an immunocompromised patient who benefited from CPT although was excluded from the clinical trial. METHODS: A 60-year-old female with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was admitted for COVID 19 pneumonia on 6/18/2020. Her current management of her RA included Rituximab infusions which she received most recently one week prior to admission. On presentation she was noted to be febrile and in hypoxic respiratory failure requiring HFNC for oxygen support. She was treated with a 5-day course of dexamethasone and Remdesivir during her hospitalization. She initially had a great clinical response and was afebrile and weaned off of supplemental oxygen by the time of discharge. Patient was re-admitted three weeks later with fevers and SOB. COVID swab remained positive and coronavirus antibodies were negative. Patient was admitted to the ICU for high oxygen O2 requirements and required intubation. Bronchoscipt with alveolar lavage was performed which revealed no bacterial or fungal source of infection. Due to continued elevation of inflammatory markers, oxygen requirement and clinical symptoms, the patient was started on a second course of Remdesivir which was extended to 10 days. The patient was approved for CPT and received transfusion two weeks after admission with no adverse effects. Patient was discharged on room air 4 days after treatment and inflammatory markers markedly trended down. Her repeat COVID swab prior to discharge was negative. RESULTS: Research surrounding CPT in immunocompromised patients infected with COVID-19 is limited. With no vaccine available, CPT has been shown to be beneficial with clearance of viral load. Our case demonstrated the successful use of CPT in an immunocompromised individual. Further research needs to be done to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT in immunocompromised patients infected with COVID 19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Septic shock is associated with reduced healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL), which may negatively impact the survivors for years after hospital discharge [1,2]. In long‐term follow‐up of HRQOL, a substantial number of patients do not respond, which hamper interpretation of the results [2,3]. OBJECTIVES. We aimed to assess risk factors for non‐response to HRQOL survey at 1‐year follow‐up in ICU patients with septic shock. METHODS. We studied all the Danish survivors in the Transfusion‐ Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial patients who were sent the Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36) 1‐year after randomisation [4,5]. Covariates from the trial database and nation‐wide registries using the unique national identification number were used to explore risk factors for not responding. Five covariates were prespecified to be included in the primary multivariate analysis: age, number of days in hospital from randomisation to follow‐up, and level of education, cohabitation, and employment status at followup. Survival from 1‐year follow‐up to the final follow‐up (median 2.7 years after randomisation) was compared between non‐responders and responders. RESULTS. Out of 321 eligible patients; we included 308 of whom 100 (35%) were non‐responders. In the primary analysis, lower age (odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI [1.01‐1.05]), more admission days in hospital (1.006 [1.001‐1.011]), and living alone (4.33 [2.46‐7.63]) were associated with non‐responding whereas level of education and employment status were not. Non‐responders had a hazard ratio of 1.63 [0.97‐2.72] for mortality from 1‐year follow‐up to final follow‐up as compared to the responders. CONCLUSIONS. Being younger, spending more days in hospital and living alone were all associated with non‐response at 1‐year HRQOL follow‐up among ICU patients with septic shock.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, the situation becomes worse if the patient has coexisting morbidities or newly developed complications. The study is about managing rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Presentation of case: The patient was a 75-year-old male, presenting with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with pulmonary embolism complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation by subcutaneous Clexane injection was administered. A left rectus haematoma was observed, and the patient fell and underwent haemorrhagic shock. Laparotomy was done for the evacuation of the haematoma. Discussion: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is an essential tool for diagnosing RSH, identifying the source of bleeding, type of haematoma, and compression of the urinary system. Conclusion: Surgical management of RSH in COVID-19 patients is superior to interventional radiology during the rush pandemic period.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

When an encephalic injury occurs tissue damage causes the release of thromboplastin-related products, mainly the Tissular Factor. This release produces an activation of the coagulation system specially through its extrinsic path. With this physiopathologic basis we attempt to improve the knowledge of this relation by performing a prospective study at the Intensive Care Unit of our Hospital. The study included 67 patients with cranioencephalic trauma alone, with an average Glasgow coma scale score of 10 and a control group consisting of 40 healthy subjects. Two peripheral vein blood extractions were performed, at admission and 24 hours later. Global coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count and fibrinogen), hypercoagulability markers (prothrombin fragments F1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT)) and thrombolisis markers (D-dimer) were determined. Our results show that early after head trauma an increase in fragments F1+2, TAT and Ddimer occur. After the first 24 hours a significant decrease in hypercoagulability markers levels is detected. Modification of the global coagulation parameters was also detected. In conclusion, early after a cranioencephalic trauma a simultaneous state of hypercoagulability and thrombolysis occur which may have the purpose of improving the hemostatic balance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Tracheostomy is usually used for patients who need prolonged mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, data on the risk factors for requiring tracheostomy and the impact of tracheostomy on outcomes in patients after Stanford type A acute aortic dissection surgery (AADS) are limited. METHODS: A retrospective single-institutional study including consecutive patients who underwent AADS between January 2016 and December 2019 was conducted. Patients who died intraoperatively were excluded. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify independent risk factors for postoperative tracheostomy (POT). A nomogram to predict the probability of POT was constructed based on independent predictors and their beta-coefficients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was performed to assess the discrimination of the model. Calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to evaluate calibration. Clinical usefulness of the nomogram was assessed by decision curve analysis. Propensity score matching analysis was used to analyze the correlation between requiring tracheostomy and clinical prognosis. RESULTS: There were 492 patients included in this study for analysis, including 55 patients (11.2%) requiring tracheostomy after AADS. Compared with patients without POT, patients with POT experienced longer ICU and hospital stay and higher mortality. Age, cerebrovascular disease history, preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count and renal insufficiency, intraoperative amount of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and platelet transfusion were identified as independent risk factors for POT. Our constructed nomogram had good discrimination with an AUC = 0.793 (0.729-0.856). Good calibration and clinical utility were observed through the calibration and decision curves, respectively. For better clinical application, we defined four intervals that stratified patients from very low to high risk for occurrence of POT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for POT and found that requiring tracheostomy was related to the poor outcomes in patients undergoing AADS. The established prediction model was validated with well predictive performance and clinical utility, and it may be useful for individual risk assessment and early clinical decision-making to reduce the incidence of tracheostomy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We queried our 17-year prospective database of patients at risk for postinjury multiple organ failure to examine the association between glucose levels and adverse outcomes. METHODS: Acutely injured patients admitted to a Level I trauma center intensive care unit from 1992 to 2008 who were more than 15 years of age, had Injury Severity Scores >15, and who survived >48 hours were eligible for the study. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of glucose control with adverse outcomes (death, ventilator-free days, intensive care unit-free days, and major infections), adjusted for Injury Severity Score, age, and red blood cell transfusion in the first 12 hours. RESULTS: Overall, 2,231 patients were eligible, of whom 153 (6.9%) died. The mean age was 37.8 ± 0.4 years, and the median Injury Severity Score was 27 (interquartile range, 21-35). The majority (77%) of these patients maintained mean glucose within conventional glucose control levels and only 10% achieved mean glucose levels within tight glucose control levels. Nonsurvivors required greater doses of insulin to control glucose levels and had greater mean insulin to glucose ratios (t test; P = .025). After adjusting for confounders, mean glucose remained significantly associated with the studied adverse outcomes. Age significantly modified all these associations with older patients seeming to benefit more from tight glucose control levels than their younger counterparts. CONCLUSION: Age is an effect modifier of the association between glucose levels and adverse outcomes. Future studies including larger samples of elderly trauma patients are needed to determine the ideal levels for glucose control in this growing population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia or suspected to have preeclampsia who underwent biophysical and biochemical investigations to measure the severity, including determining maternal hemodynamic indices, mean arterial pressure, fetal biometric and Doppler parameters, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor levels. The performance of these markers, individually or in combination, in predicting adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes was then assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. An adverse maternal outcome was defined as 1 or more of severe hypertension; admission to the intensive care unit; eclampsia; placental abruption; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low-platelet count syndrome; disseminated intravascular coagulation; platelets <100×109/L; creatinine >1.1 mg/dL; and alanine aminotransferase >100 U/L. An adverse perinatal outcome was defined as 1 or more of preterm birth ≤34+0 weeks’ gestation, neonatal intensive care unit admission for >48 hours, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and confirmed fetal infection. RESULTS: We recruited 91 women with preeclampsia with a mean gestational age of 30.63±2.86 weeks. Women who had adverse maternal events had higher median maternal concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (11,500.0 pg/mL vs 3051.0 pg/mL; P<.001), lower concentrations of placental growth factor (44.88 pg/mL vs 148.50 pg/mL; P<.001), and a higher sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (306.22 vs 30.63; P<.001) than women who did not. Pregnancies with an adverse perinatal outcome also had a higher soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase concentration (12,100.0 pg/mL vs 3051.0 pg/mL; P<.001), lower placental growth factor concentration (27.2 pg/mL vs 148.50 pg/mL; P<.001), and higher sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (378.45.4 vs 30.63; P<.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase and placental growth factor were the best biomarkers when compared with other biochemical markers to predict adverse maternal (area under the curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.90) and fetal (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96) outcomes in preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio correlates better with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes than any other biochemical marker in an Indian population. The incorporation of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in women with preeclampsia can help in predicting the severity of the condition and the timings of the delivery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study examined patient outcomes with severe hepatic injuries to determine the association of in-hospital mortality with AE. The hypothesis is that AE is associated with increased survival in severe hepatic injuries. Methods: Demographics, age, sex, MOI, shock index (SI), ≥6 units packed red blood cells (PRBCs) per hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, injury severity score (ISS), and AE were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients were stratified into groups according to MOI, AE, and operative vs non-operative management. Multivariable logistic regression determined the independent association of mortality with AE vs no AE and operative vs nonoperative management and modeled the odds of mortality controlling for MOI, AE vs no AE, age and ISS groups, SI >.9, and ≥6 units PRBCs/LOS. Results: From 2013 to 2018, 2462 patients (1744 blunt; 718 penetrating) were treated for severe hepatic injuries. AE was used in only 21% of patients. Mortality rates increased with higher ISS and age. AE was associated with mortality when compared to patients who did not undergo AE. The strongest associations with mortality were ISS ≥25, transfusion ≥ 6 units PRBCs/LOS, and age ≥65 years. Conclusions: AE is underutilized in severe hepatic trauma. AE may be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of severe hepatic injuries especially in older patients and those needing exploratory laparotomy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of D-ICH.Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients that presented directly from the scene of injury to an adult major trauma center from Jan 2013 to Dec 2018.Results: There were 6536 patients who had an initial normal CTB and 23 (0.3%; 95%CI: 0.20-0.47) had D-ICH. There were 653 patients who had a repeat CTB (incidence of D-ICH 3.5%; 95%CI: 2.2-5.2). There was no significant association of D-ICH with age>65 years (OR 1.33; 95%CI: 0.54-3.29), presenting GCS <15 (OR 1.21; 95% CI: 0.52-2.80) and anti-platelet medications (OR 0.68; 95%CI: 0.26-1.74). Exposure to anti-coagulant medications was associated with lower odds of D-ICH (OR 0.23; 95%CI: 0.05-0.99). All cases of D-ICH were diffuse injury type II lesions on the Marshall classification. There were no cases that underwent neurosurgical intervention and no deaths were attributed to D-ICH.Conclusions: These results question observation of patients with head injury in hospital after a normal CTB for the sole purpose of excluding D-ICH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Enzyme activity was normal in all of the surgical 'control' patients. All the 17 patients with hemorrhagic vascular lesions had an elevation of CSF enzyme activity. Among the 30 patients with nonhemorrhagic lesions, 27 had similar but smaller elevations. Serum enzyme elevations were less frequent and were usually independent of those in the CSF. There was no correlation between CSF and blood abnormalities. In 20 patients with nonhemorrhagic disease, the enzymes of the spinal fluid were elevated when the protein value was within normal limits. The specificity of CPK in brain tissue and its negligible quantity in the human erythrocyte makes it the most appropriate enzyme for study of cerebral damage when there is blood contaminating the CSF. In nonhemorrhagic cases, the likelihood of an abnormal value was much greater when all 3 enzymes were considered.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The cross-matched packed red cells/transfusion ratio was 1.8, while request/transfusion was 1.7 for the fresh frozen plasma and 1.23 for platelets. Packed red blood cells were the main blood product used in blood transfusion (BT). General surgery/orthopedics and intensive care unit were reported with a greater number of requests. The main indications noted for blood requisition were surgery and anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines appear to be respected within services regarding BT decision criteria. However, about half of the requested blood is not transfused which suggest further improvement. Adherence to established guidelines seems variables among different departments.

However, the etiology, clinical course, and risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and location of acute GI bleeding associated with NOACs and its severity and outcomes compared to VKA. This retrospective multicenter study included 381 subjects on anticoagulants who underwent appropriate diagnostic examination due to GI bleeding. Regarding the characteristics of acute GI bleeding, the proportion of vascular lesions was significantly lower in the NOACs group than that in the VKA group. Small bowel bleeding occurred less commonly in the NOACs group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Regarding severity and clinical outcomes, patients on NOACs received significantly smaller volumes of transfused blood products and had shorter ICU stays than those on VKA. Moreover, the need for surgery and the risk of rebleeding in the NOACs group were significantly lower than those in the VKA group.

Due to the incompletely understood pathophysiology, new GI complications are continuously reported. Ischemic proctitis (IP) is a rare complication as the rectum has excellent collateral blood supply from the rectal arteries. We present a case of an elderly patient with IP in the setting of COVID-19. Case Description/Methods: A 66-year-old female with type 2 DM, hypertension, and GERD presented to the ED with severe shortness of breath and cough and was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. She was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir, therapeutic-dose enoxaparin and ceftriaxone. Her oxygen requirements increased, and she was transferred to the ICU for intubation and vasopressor support on day 4. Given a persistent decrease in hemoglobin requiring RBC and platelet transfusions on day 6, occult GI bleeding was suspected and she underwent emergent flexible sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy showed necrotic circumferential mucosa with a large amount of blood clots starting 5cm from the anal verge and extending to 10cm in the rectum. The clots were removed, and after injection with epinephrine, no active bleeding was noted. Biopsies were taken from edges of the mucosal necrosis. The endoscope was advanced 50cm into descending colon and no active bleeding or abnormal mucosa were noted. Pathology showed marked mucosal necrosis and fibroinflammatory exudate. The patient further decompensated with superposed bacterial pneumonia, shock, AKI requiring hemodialysis, and expired one month after admission. (Figure) Discussion: COVID-19 causes a variety of respiratory symptoms in different stages of illness. Additionally, GI symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea were linked to the virus. GI complications, such as mesenteric ischemia or ischemic colitis have also been associated with the virus due to shock and hypercoagulability. Although superficial ischemic events causing shallow mucosal ulcers are common, IP is extremely rare in the clinical setting. The protective mechanism against IP includes rectal blood supply by the inferior mesenteric, internal iliac and internal pudendal arteries. The main underlying causes of IP include severe vascular disease, acute vascular occlusion, previous vascular intervention, aorto-iliac surgery, and vasculitis. The treatment of ischemic proctitis is largely supportive but may be challenging when managing transmural rectal ischemia or gangrene, often requiring surgery and proctectomy as the definitive treatment (Figure Presented).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Design: Systematic literature review; prospective cohort study. Setting: Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. Patients: All patients (n = 692) admitted for >24 hrs between May 1988 and March 1990. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Computerized database review of MEDLINE identified clinical studies of multiple organ failure that were published between 1969 and 1993. Variables from these studies were evaluated for construct and content validity to identify optimal descriptors of organ dysfunction. Clinical and laboratory data were collected daily to evaluate the performance of these variables individually and in aggregate as an organ dysfunction score. Seven systems defined the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in more than half of the 30 published reports reviewed. Descriptors meeting criteria for construct and content validity could be identified for five of these seven systems: a) the respiratory system (O2/FIO2 ratio); b) the renal system (serum creatinine concentration); c) the hepatic system (serum bilirubin concentration); d) the hematologic system (platelet count); and e) the central nervous system (Glasgow Coma Scale). In the absence of an adequate descriptor of cardiovascular dysfunction, we developed a new variable, the pressure- adjusted heart rate, which is calculated as the product of the heart rate and the ratio of central venous pressure to mean arterial pressure. These candidate descriptors of organ dysfunction were then evaluated for criterion validity (ICU mortality rate) using the clinical database. From the first half of the database (the development set), intervals for the most abnormal value of each variable were constructed on a scale from 0 to 4 so that a value of 0 represented essentially normal function and was associated with an ICU mortality rate of <5%, whereas a value of 4 represented marked functional derangement and an ICU mortality rate of ≥50%. These intervals were then tested on the second half of the data set (the validation set). Maximal scores for each variable were summed to yield a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (maximum of 24). This score correlated in a graded fashion with the ICU mortality rate, both when applied on the first day of ICU admission as a prognostic indicator and when calculated over the ICU stay as an outcome measure. For the latter, ICU mortality was ~25% at 9 to 12 points, 50% at 13 to 16 points, 75% at 17 to 20 points, and 100% at levels of >20 points. The score showed excellent discrimination, as reflected in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.936 in the development set and 0.928 in the validation set. The incremental increase in scores over the course of the ICU stay (calculated as the difference between maximal scores and those scores obtained on the first day [i.e., the A Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score]) also demonstrated a strong correlation with the ICU mortality rate. In a logistic regression model, this incremental increase in scores accounted for more of the explanatory power than admission severity indices. Conclusions: This multiple organ dysfunction score, constructed using simple physiologic measures of dysfunction in six organ systems, mirrors organ dysfunction as the intensivist sees it and correlates strongly with the ultimate risk of ICU mortality and hospital mortality. The variable, Δ Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score, reflects organ dysfunction developing during the ICU stay, which therefore is potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation. As an outcome measure complementary to predictive scores now widely available, such a score may find use in epidemiologic studies of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Moreover, an instrument that can provide an objective measure of the severity of organ dysfunction at the time of ICU admission and that can quantify subsequent deterioration over the course of the ICU stay may prove useful as an alternative end point for clinical trials involving critically ill patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of intensive care unit patients with pulmonary artery catheters was conducted at two military medical centers. RESULTS: RBC transfusion is associated with a sustained (≥4 hours) statistically significant 2- to 3-mm Hg rise in MPAP relative to both pretransfusion levels (p < 0.05) and compared to asanguinous fluid infusions (p < 0.05). The magnitude of the rise (all infusions, RBCs, and asanguinous) correlates positively with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.01) and hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). The duration of RBC storage was not statistically correlated with the magnitude of rise in the population studied. Mean infusion volume was greater for RBC (vs. asanguinous) infusions, but volume adjustment of MPAP values did not alter the pattern or statistical significance of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of retrospectively collected data suggests that transfusion of RBC-containing fluids results in a sustained elevation of MPAP. In the patient population studied, the duration of RBC storage did not correlate with the magnitude of MPAP rise. Future prospective studies of transfusion effects should consider including assessment of MPAP and subpopulation analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients were matched for age, gender, mechanism of injury, and injury severity score. SI and ED Delta SI were calculated. ED Delta SI >0.1 and ≤0.1 defined the study groups.

METHOD: The study was conducted with 12 brain death patients mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. The patients were ventilated with 21%, 40%, and 100% oxygen before induction of apnea testing performed for diagnosis of brain death. Blood samples were obtained at each oxygen concentration value for all patients. RESULT: The results of the study indicated no significant change of red blood cell aggregation, deformability and plasma or whole blood viscosity associated with acute hyperoxia at normobaric conditions. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that application of normobaric hyperoxia does not have detrimental effects on hemorheological parameters in brain death patients, and that organs considered for donation from such subjects are not adversely affected by abnormalities of blood flow and tissue perfusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Excessive blood sampling can cause harm to patients, putting them at risk of iatrogenic anaemia and unnecessary blood transfusions1 and can have a significant financial implications2. The ease of taking blood from indwelling arterial lines and the use of a protocol based blood sampling can easily lead to unnecessary samples being taken. OBJECTIVES. In this audit we aimed to assess the number and type of blood tests taken on the intensive care unit (ITU) and high dependency unit (HDU) at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK and whether they were clinically required. METHODS. Data was collected once weekly for four consecutive weeks. For each patient on ITU or HDU that day, the blood samples taken over the preceding week were recorded and notes were reviewed to assess reasons for clotting screens and blood transfusions. The blood tests recorded were full blood count, urea and electrolytes, magnesium, liver function tests, bone profile (calcium, albumin and phosphate), clotting screens and blood cultures. RESULTS. Data was recorded for a total of 185 ITU/HDU patient days. Over this time a total of 1494 blood samples were recorded. This amounts to an approximate total volume of 2.5 l of blood or an average a 13.5 ml/person/day. When reasons for clotting screens were assessed, the most common reasons were as part of a routine protocol (39 %), for patients on haemofiltration (26 %) and on admission (15 %). It was noted that where patients had a normal initial INR, there was little variation in an individual patients INR in subsequent tests (range 0-0.7 variation in INRs taken over a week). Seven patients required a blood transfusion during this period, four of which were required for acute bleeding. CONCLUSION. Too many blood samples are taken without a clear clinical indication. The number of unnecessary tests could be reduced by moving away from a protocol based system for blood sampling3. A reduction in the number of clotting screens performed, particularly in level two patients, is likely to reduce the volume of blood lost per patient and the cost of blood sampling without impacting on patient care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Study design Multicenter, international, prospective, randomized and controlled study. Patient population 1. Inclusion criteria: Adult (> 18 years) patients undergoing cardiac operations with CPB. Expected CPB duration > 90 minutes. 2. Exclusion criteria: severe chronic renal failure (dialysis or serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL); emergent (must be operated immediately) procedure; moderate‐severe anemia (preoperative HCT < 32%); expected nadir CPB temperature < 32 °C. 3. Withdrawal criteria (after randomization): Need for allogeneic blood transfusions before CPB. Need for allogeneic blood to prime the CPB circuit. DHCA or other violations of the entry criteria. CPB duration below 90 minutes will not be withdrawal criterion, but a subroup analysis is anticipated. Primary outcomes Incidence of AKI, defined according to the AKIN criteria (9) as: AKI stage 1: peak postoperative serum creatinine > 1.5 x baseline or absolute increase 0.3 mg/dL, within the first 48 hours after surgery. AKI stage 2: peak postoperative serum creatinine > 2.0 x baseline, within the first 48 hours after surgery (AKI stage 3 will be incorporated in the AKI stage 2 group). Any AKI: stage 1 or higher Peak serum creatinine: within the first 48 postoperative hours. Diagnosis of AKI must be reached within the first 48 hours after surgery, but staging may require a longer time (up to 7 days after surgery). Secondary outcomes Length of ICU stay (days) Transfusion (red blood cells) rate and amount of red blood cells units transfused Major morbidity (according to STS): mechanical ventilation > 48 hours, AKI stage 2, surgical revision, mediastinitis, stroke. Operative (in‐hospital) mortality 3. Sample size The power analysis is based on the primary outcome ""any AKI"". Data from the previous study (1) provide the following figures for the total patient population: Any AKI rate: 21.2% AKI stage 1: 8.8% AKI stage 2‐3: 12.4% With the following distribution according to a cut‐off value settled at a nadir DO2 of 280 mL/min/m2. Outcome All cases N=354 DO2 < 280 mL/min/m2 N= 181 DO2 ≥ 280 mL/min/m2 N= 173 P Any AKI 75 (21.2%) 54 (29.8%) 21 (12.1%) 0.001 AKI stage 1 31 (8.8%) 23 (12.7%) 8 (4.6%) 0.007 AKI stage 2‐3 44 (12.4%) 31 (17.1%) 13 (7.5%) 0.006 Based on the above table, we know that the Control Group will spontaneously meet the goal in 50% of the cases, and that will have an any AKI rate of 21%. We hypothesize that the Goal‐Directed Perfusion (GDP) group will meet the goal in 95% of the cases. When the goal is met, the AKIN rate will be 12%; when it is not, it will be 29% This will lead to an expected AKI rate in GDP group of 12.8%. Therefore, the effect size will be a 40% reduction in the AKI rate (12.8% in GDP group, 21% in Control group. Based on this effect size, an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.20, the number of patients in each group is 350, for a total patient population of 700. Data analysis will be restricted to patients with a CPB duration > 60 minutes. Same applies to extremely long CPB duration, based on the percentile distribution of CPB. Interim analyses planned at 25%, 50%, and 75% of patients enrollment, with stopping rules for futility, safety, efficacy. Stopping rule for futility: relative risk for the primary outcome not inclusing the hypothesized value of 0.6 within 99% confidence interval at 50% interim analysis or 95% at 75% interim analysis. Stopping rule for efficacy in presence of a difference in favour of the GDP arm at a P value of 0.01 at 25% interim analysis or 0.05 at the 50% and 75% interim analyses. Stopping rule for safety in presence of a difference in favor of the control arm at a P value of 0.01 at the 25% interim analysis or 0.05 at the 50% and 75% interim analyses (Ethics Committe amendment August 2016). 4. Interventions Patients will be randomly allocated to the Control or the GDP group. Randomization will be performed locally at each participating Institution, using computer‐generated schemes. The patients in control Group will be treated according to the local standards. The patients in GDP group will be treated according to the GDP (see table below).

Additional interventions include hemofiltration to increase the HCT. Transfusion protocol 1. During CPB: Transfusions are mandatory below a HCT of 18%. Transfusions are generally prohibited for an HCT > 21%. However, based on the individual judgement that the patient is actually in need for packed red cells, transfusions are allowed between an HCT of 22% and 24%. In this case, this will be considered as a protocol violation, but the patient will not be withdrawn. Transfusions are always prohibited for an HCT > 24%. 2. After CPB: HCT < 18%: packed red cells are mandatory HCT between 19% and 23%: packed red cells are allowed HCT between 24% and 30%: packed red cells generally prohibited, but admitted based on physician's judgement. This represents a protocol violation. In this case, this will be considered as a protocol violation, but the patient will not be withdrawn. HCT > 30%: packed red cells are prohibited.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In this quality improvement intervention we assessed the effect of an institutional protocol and computerized decision support for red cell transfusion in the critically ill. DESIGN: We compared processes of care and outcomes during the two 3-month periods before and after the introduction of a multidisciplinary quality improvement intervention. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care units--medical, surgical, and mixed--in a tertiary academic center. PATIENTS: Consecutive critically ill patients with anemia (hemoglobin of <10 g/dL). INTERVENTION: Using the computerized provider order entry, we developed an evidence-based decision algorithm for red cell transfusion in adult intensive care units. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected information on demographics, diagnosis, severity of illness, transfusion complications, and laboratory values. The main outcome measures were number of transfusions, proportion of patients who were transfused outside evidence-based indications, transfusion complications, and adjusted hospital mortality. The mean number of red cell transfusions per intensive care unit admission decreased from 1.08 +/- 2.3 units before to 0.86 +/- 2.3 units after the protocol (p<.001). We observed a marked decrease in the percentage of patients receiving inappropriate transfusions (17.7% vs. 4.5%, p< .001). The rate of transfusion complications was also lower in the period after the protocol (6.1% vs. 2.7%, p = .015). In the multivariate analysis, protocol introduction was associated with decreased likelihood of red cell transfusion (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.62). Adjusted hospital mortality did not differ before and after protocol implementation (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an institutional protocol and decision support through a computerized provider order entry effectively decreased inappropriate red cell transfusions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Included"", ""takashi""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Shodai""=>[""こちらは前後調査ではないでしょうか？"", ""同じ患者の前後比較でなければ良いので、full textを確認しましょう。""], ""takashi""=>[""前後調査でプロトコール導入して輸血量がふえたかへったかだと思うのですが、これもIncludeのほうがいいでしょうか？前後研究除外のほうがいいかと思いました。""]}",,"",,

When not readily identified alternative diagnosis should be considered. Hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP) is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that describes hemorrhage originating from the pancreatic duct via the ampulla of vater. Few cases of HP have been reported as the cause of large volume hematemesis, hematochezia, and anemia yet it represents a true medical emergency. Often it remains low or is omitted from the differential due to the intermittent nature of the bleed and because it is not visualized by endoscopy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54 year old African American male who presented with acute blood loss anemia with hemodynamic instability and hematemesis. His past medical history includes prior history chronic anemia, chronic pancreatitis, history of multiple gastroenterology bleeds, hyperlipidemia, tobacco and alcohol use. He was admitted to the ICU for the initiation of rapid blood transfusion protocol requiring 23 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and several liters of crystalloid fluids. Initially, an EGD, and two nuclear medicine GI bleeding scans were negative. A third bleeding scan identified the pancreas as the source. An abdominal MRI with IV contrast showed 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass at the head of the pancreas with tubular enhancing structure with surrounding complex fluid indicated a pseudocyst with an abnormal vessel that eroded into the center. Pancreatic ductal dilatation was also noted and was likely secondary to mass effect from the abnormality. Interventional Radiology confirmed the diagnosis of HP with successful coiling of a branch of the right colic artery preventing further hemorrhage. A medical record search revealed that a similar structure was found in 2012 on CT Abdomen with contrast but at that time it was smaller, measured 1.4 cm. At that point no definitive intervention was performed as the diagnosis of hemosuccous pancreaticus was not considered. Since 2012 this patient had several GI bleeding episodes requiring transfusion of 42 pRBC units. He had also undergone twelve non-invasive procedures and eleven invasive procedures prior to the final coiling of the right colic artery by interventional radiology. DISCUSSION: To this day, HP has no succinct diagnostic clinical or imaging criteria and endovascular embolization remains the initial treatment for HP. If no succinct source is found with non-invasive modalities, surgical pancreatectomy must be considered. The surgical intervention includes resection of the pancreas head or tail. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that HP should be considered in patients that develop GI bleed with no clear endoscopic etiology. Having an expanded differential could have spared procedure exposure and optimized cost effectiveness of the patient’s health care. Physician awareness is the key to make the correct diagnosis.

Methods: A total of 180 children requiring packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were randomized into two groups: the liberal transfusion strategy group (transfusion trigger < 10 g/dL, Group 1) and the restrictive transfusion strategy group (transfusion trigger ≤ 7 g/dL, Group 2). Basal variables including venous/arterial hemoglobin, hematocrit and lactate levels; stroke volume; and cardiac output were recorded at the beginning and end of the transfusion. Oxygen saturation, noninvasive total hemoglobin, noninvasive total oxygen content, perfusion index (PI), heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were assessed via the Radical‐7 Pulse co‐oximeter (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA) with the Root monitor, initially and at 4 h. Results: In all, 160 children were eligible for final analysis. The baseline hemoglobin level for the PRBC transfusion was 7.38 ± 0.98 g/dL for all patients. At the end of the PRBC transfusion, cardiac output decreased by 9.9% in Group 1 and by 24% in Group 2 (p  < 0.001); PI increased by 10% in Group 1 and by 45% in Group 2 (p  < 0.001). Lactate decreased by 9.8% in Group 1 and by 31.68% in Group 2 (p < 0.001).

Although effective in reducing the need for transfusion of blood and blood products, safety concerns still prevail. OBJECTIVE: To compare the dosing and efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII between pediatric and adult patients, and in the operating room and intensive care unit. METHODS: The records of 69 patients (33 children and 36 adults) who underwent cardiovascular surgery and received recombinant activated factor VII were reviewed retrospectively. The dose of recombinant activated factor VII, mediastinal drainage, use of blood and blood products, incidence of thrombosis, and 28-day mortality were studied. RESULTS: the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII was comparable in adults and children, despite the lower dose in adults. Prophylactic use of recombinant activated factor VII decreased the incidence of mediastinal exploration and the duration of intensive care unit stay. A 4.3% incidence of thrombotic complications was observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The efficacious dose of recombinant activated factor VII is much less in adults compared to children. Prophylactic use of recombinant activated factor VII decreases the dose required, the incidence of mediastinal exploration, and intensive care unit stay, with no survival benefit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study was conducted to characterize the use of initial prophylactic antibiotic use in open fractures, guideline compliance, and its impact on care. Methods: Retrospective chart review of adult patients presenting with an open fracture to a Level 1 Trauma Center Emergency Department over a 12-month period was conducted. Results: Of the 202 patients meeting inclusion criteria, overall compliance with guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis was found to be 33.2%. The duration of prophylactic therapy was significantly longer in the noncompliant group and among those who received a secondary antibiotic (P <.05 for both comparisons). The duration of therapy was found to be significantly longer in those patients who developed an infection (P <.001). Those who developed an infection had a longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (P <.001) and intensive care unit LOS (P =.002). In addition, those who developed an infection had significantly more surgeries (P <.001) and received more red blood cell transfusions (P <.001). Correlation analysis confirmed a significant association between infection and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis (P =.02), number of surgeries (P <.0001), and number of transfusions (P <.0001). Conclusion: Guideline compliance was exceedingly low due to the extended duration of initial antibiotic therapy and did not appear to yield any clinical benefits. Infection was significantly associated with longer duration of initial prophylactic therapy and morbidity. Opportunities exist to elevate compliance with guidelines and to reevaluate prophylactic antimicrobial therapy in this setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

He is operated on in a maximum care hospital and then transferred to the critical care unit. From then on, an anonymous, very experienced physician continuously takes care of him. Four nights before Christmas, the ghost of the famous British physiologist Ernest Henry Starling appears at the patient’s bed. The ghost involves the anonymous physician in a dialogue and is very interested in the inserted Swan-Ganz catheter, then he disappears. He repeats his visits the next 3 nights. On the first occasion he is displeased with Cratchit’s low haematocrit, the second time he dislikes the mechanical ventilator settings, and on his final visit he is concerned with Cratchit’s clinical nutrition. At first, the anonymous physician is indignant with the ghost’s criticism and indoctrinations, but then recognizes that ultimately they are the key to Cratchit’s convalescence and acts accordingly. Successfully! Following the ghost’s proposals, he changes the ventilator settings, transfuses 3 units of packed red blood cells, and starts clinical nutrition. Shortly thereafter, Cratchit’s trachea is extubated, and on New Year’s Day he is ready to be discharged from the critical care unit. In this essay, Robert Bartlett transposed Charles Dickens’ “Christmas Carol” into the world of critical care. Its intention is to encourage the intensivist to scrutinize common therapeutic measures, such as mechanical ventilation, haemodynamic interventions and transfusion of blood products.

METHODS: We included 28 alloimmunised pregnant women at significant risk of fetal or neonatal anaemia who did not have invasive testing because of reassuring MCA Doppler velocimetry. Women requiring invasive testing or intrauterine transfusion were excluded. Outcome measures were admission to neonatal intensive care unit, cord haemoglobin and bilirubin levels and neonatal therapy. RESULTS: Ten neonates (36%) were anaemic at birth while 18 (64%) had normal haemoglobin. Seven neonates (25%) did not require any form of neonatal therapy, 10 (36%) had phototherapy only, 7 (25%) required exchange transfusions and 4 (14%) top-up transfusions. There were no treatment-related complications. Mean cord haemoglobin was 13.9 g/dl (range 7-18.9) and mean bilirubin was 84.1 micromol/l (range 29-192). CONCLUSION: Avoiding invasive procedures in pregnancies at risk of fetal anaemia by relying on reassuring MCA Doppler velocimetry did not result in life-threatening fetal or neonatal morbidities. The extent of neonatal therapy was acceptable. The routine use of this test can lead to less unnecessary invasive procedures in at-risk fetuses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Early or late postinfection treatment of influenza-infected mice with the liponucleotide cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) resulted in decreased hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung dysfunction, and inflammation without altering viral replication. These findings suggested CDP-choline could have benefit as adjunctive treatment for ARDS in veterinary patients (VetARDS). OBJECTIVES: Determine if parenterally administered CDP-choline can attenuate mild VetARDS in dogs with aspiration pneumonia. ANIMALS: Dogs admitted to a veterinary intensive care unit (ICU) for aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with vehicle (0.1 mL/kg sterile 0.9% saline, IV; n = 8) or CDP-choline (5 mg/kg in 0.1 mL/kg 0.9% saline, IV; n = 9) q12h over the first 48 hours after ICU admission. RESULTS: No significant differences in signalment or clinical findings were found between placebo- and CDP-choline-treated dogs on admission. All dogs exhibited tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. CDP-choline administration resulted in rapid, progressive, and clinically relevant increases in oxygenation as determined by pulse oximetry and ratios of arterial oxygen partial pressure (P(a) O(2) mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (% F(i) O(2) ) and decreases in alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradients that did not occur in placebo (saline)-treated animals. Treatment with CDP-choline was also associated with less platelet consumption over the first 48 hours, but had no detectable detrimental effects. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ctyidine diphosphcholine acts rapidly to promote gas exchange in dogs with naturally occurring aspiration pneumonia and is a potential adjunctive treatment in VetARDS patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: We included 23 panelists in 8 countries and assessed and managed financial and intellectual conflicts of interest. Methodological support was provided by the Guidelines in Intensive Care, Development, and Evaluation (GUIDE) group. We conducted a systematic review, including evidence from observational and randomized studies. Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we evaluated the certainty of evidence and developed recommendations using the Evidence-to-Decision framework. RESULTS: We identified 8 studies (1 cluster and 2 patient-level randomized trials; 5 observational studies) comparing small-volume to conventional tubes. We had high certainty evidence that small-volume tubes reduce daily and cumulative blood sampling volume; and moderate certainty evidence that they reduce the risk of transfusion and mean number of red blood cell units transfused, but these estimates were limited by imprecision. We had high certainty that small-volume tubes have a similar rate of specimens with insufficient quantity. The panel considered that the desirable effects of small-volume tubes outweigh the undesirable effects, are less wasteful of resources, and are feasible, as demonstrated by successful implementation across multiple countries, although there are upfront implementation costs to validate small-volume tubes on laboratory instrumentation. CONCLUSION: This ICM-RPG panel made a strong recommendation for the use of small-volume sample collection tubes in adult ICUs based on overall moderate certainty evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

A number of treatments have been introduced to treat the condition but it is unclear which intervention improves maternal and fetal outcome. Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of treatment modalities in twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised studies of amnioreduction versus laser coagulation, septostomy versus laser coagulation or septostomy versus amnioreduction. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results: Three studies (253 women and 506 babies) were included. All three trials were judged to be of moderate quality. One study compared amnioreduction with septostomy (71 women), whilst the other two studies compared amnioreduction with endoscopic laser coagulation (182 women). Not all trials provided outcome data that could be included in all meta-analyses. Amnioreduction compared with laser coagulationAlthough there was no difference in overall death between amnioreduction and laser coagulation (average risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.38 adjusted for clustering, two trials) or death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09, two trials), or death of both infants per pregnancy (average RR 0.76; 95% 0.27 to 2.10, two trials), more babies were alive without neurological abnormality at the age of six years in the laser group than in the amnioreduction groups (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.34 adjusted for clustering, one trial). There were no significant differences in the babies alive at six years with major neurological abnormality treated by laser coagulation or amnioreduction (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.77 adjusted for clustering, one trial). Outcomes for death in this 2013 update are different from the previous 2008 update, where improvements in perinatal death and death of both infants per pregnancy were shown in the laser intervention arm. The NIHCD trial included in this update exerts an opposite direction of effects to the Eurofetus study, which was previously the only included laser study, hence the difference in outcome. Amnioreduction compared with septostomy There are no differences in overall death (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, adjusted for clustering, one trial), death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35, one trial), or death of both infants per pregnancy (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.22, one trial) or gestational age at birth (RR 1.20; 95% CI -0.81 to 3.21, one trial) between amnioreduction and septostomy. Authors' conclusions: Endoscopic laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels should continue to be considered in the treatment of all stages of twin-twin transfusion syndrome to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Further research targeted towards assessing the effect of treatment on milder (Quintero stage 1 and 2) and more severe (Quintero stage 4) forms of twin-twin transfusion syndrome is required. Studies should aim to assess long-term outcomes of survivors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Box 85",,"We have previously shown that when siRNA against Int6 (siRNA-Int6) was used, hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) activity was stabilized even under normoxic conditions, and the expression of several angiogenic factors was increased. In neuronal tissues, the mechanism underlying angiogenesis remains largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the role of the tumor suppressor Int6/eIF3e in the regulation of the expression of angiogenic factors in neuronal cells. In addition, we test whether siRNA-Int6 reduces cold-induced brain damage in rats. We used human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells transfected with either siRNA-Int6, or a negative control siRNA. Real-time PCR and supersensitive multiplex assay were used to detect gene and protein expression of several angiogenic factors after transfection. For the animal studies, Wistar rats were subjected to brain damage by cold injury, and 50μg siRNA-Int6, 100μg siRNA-Int6, or negative control was administrated. At day 7 post-treatment, brain sections were stained and image analysis system was used to determine the damaged area. Our experiments using SHSY5Y cells revealed a significant effect of siRNA-Int6 on the expression of HIF2α but not HIF1α, both at 8 and 24. h after transfection. The siRNA-Int6 led to significant up-regulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-B, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, our animal studies revealed significantly reduced area of cold-induced damage in rats receiving siRNA-Int6, compared to negative controls. Our findings indicate that Int6 act as a hypoxia-independent master switch of angiogenesis in neuronal cells, and that inhibition of Int6 by siRNA may be an effective therapeutic strategy in treating ischemic diseases such as brain ischemia and injury. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We analyzed data from 11 sickle cell patients who contracted COVID-19 between June and December 2020 and were treated at the CRLD (Center for Sickle Cell Disease and Research). The patients' COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed using the (Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction) RT-PCR technique on nasopharyngeal swab samples and/or based on clinical and radiological findings, including CT scans. The patients consisted of 7 males and 4 females, with a mean age of 40 ± 12 years. The sickle cell phenotypes observed were SC (45.4%), SS (36.37%), and Sβ± thalassemia (18.2%). During the COVID-19 infection, we observed a slight increase in white blood cell and platelet counts, but a decrease in mean hemoglobin levels and red blood cells. Only 3 out of 11 patients (28%) had a fever at the time of diagnosis.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of REBOA on a multi-institutional level in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes in trauma patients after REBOA placement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control retrospective analysis was performed of the 2015-2016 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program data set, a national multi-institutional database of trauma patients in the United States. A total of 593 818 adult trauma patients (aged ≥18 years) were analyzed and 420 patients were matched and included in the study; patients who were dead on arrival or were transferred from other facilities were excluded. Trauma patients who underwent REBOA placement in the ED were identified and matched with a similar cohort of patients (the no-REBOA group). Both groups were matched in a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching for demographics, vital signs, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, head abbreviated injury scale score, each body region abbreviated injury scale score, pelvic fractures, lower extremity vascular injuries and fractures, and number and grades of intra-abdominal solid organ injuries. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures were the rates of complications and mortality. RESULTS: Of 593 818 trauma patients, 420 patients (the REBOA group, 140 patients; 36 women and 104 men; mean [SD] age, 44 [20] years; the no-REBOA group, 280 patients; 77 women and 203 men; mean [SD] age, 43 [19] years) were matched and included in the analysis. Among the REBOA group, median injury severity score was 29 (interquartile range [IQR], 18-38) and 129 patients (92.1%) had a blunt mechanism of injury. There was no significant difference between groups in median 4-hour blood transfusion (REBOA: packed red blood cells, 6 U [IQR, 3-8 U]; platelets, 4 U [IQR, 3-9 U], and plasma, 3 U [IQR, 2-5 U]; and no-REBOA: packed red blood cells, 7 U [IQR, 3-9 U]; platelets, 4 U [IQR, 3-8 U], and plasma, 3 U [IQR, 2-6 U]) or 24-hour blood transfusion (REBOA: packed red blood cells, 9 U [IQR, 5-20 U]; platelets, 7 U [IQR, 3-13 U], and plasma, 9 U [IQR, 6-20 U]; and no-REBOA: packed red blood cells, 10 U [IQR, 4-21 U]; platelets, 8 U [IQR, 3-12 U], and plasma, 10 U [IQR, 7-20 U]), median hospital length of stay (REBOA, 8 days [IQR, 1-20 days]; and no-REBOA, 10 days [IQR, 5-22 days]), or median intensive care unit length of stay (REBOA, 5 days [IQR, 2-14 days]; and no-REBOA, 6 days [IQR, 3-15 days]). The mortality rate was higher in the REBOA group as compared with the no-REBOA group (50 [35.7%] vs 53 [18.9%]; P = .01). Patients who underwent REBOA placement were also more likely to develop acute kidney injury (15 [10.7%] vs 9 [3.2%]; P = .02) and more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation (5 [3.6%] vs 2 [0.7%]; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Placement of REBOA in severely injured trauma patients was associated with a higher mortality rate compared with a similar cohort of patients with no placement of REBOA. Patients in the REBOA group also had higher rates of acute kidney injury and lower leg amputations. There is a need for a concerted effort to clearly define when and in which patient population REBOA has benefit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has shown some benefits for cytokine clearance in sepsis with multiorgan failure in the past and in 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. We combined both therapies together for COVID-19 treatment. Objectives: To evaluate safety and efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma therapy in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARSCOV-2) infections. Methods: 6 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with one session TPE followed by 500 ml convalescent plasma transfusion in addition to standard treatment who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and life threatening illness (PAO2/FIO2 < 300 and mechanical ventilation, shock, organ failure). The study was conducted at Mediclinic City Hospital, Dubai, UAE from April 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020. Outcomes measured were death from any cause, time to negative SARS-COV-2 PCR, time to removal of mechanical ventilation after intervention, clinical (body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, PAO2/FIO2), biochemical (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, procalcitonin) and radiological parameters before and after therapy. Mechanical ventilation days, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay were also measured. Results: Patients were in the age range of 36-65 years, 4 males and two females. All patients were receiving mechanical ventilation, Methylprednisone and therapeutic anticoagulation. All the patients survived and were discharged home. Time to negative SARS-COV-2 RT PCR was 1-18 days and time to removal of mechanical ventilation was 2-41 days after intervention. Out of six, 4 patients were off mechanical ventilation within 7 days of therapy. 3 out of 6 patients had normal body temperature, 5 had improved PAO2/FIO2 within 48hrs. SOFA score improved by 2 points within 48 hrs in 3 patients and within 5 days in another 2 patients. All the biochemical parameters improved within 48 hrs except D-dimer which worsened in 3 patients after therapy. Chest X ray showed improvement in pulmonary lesions within 48 hrs and significant improvement by day 7. Mechanical ventilation days, ICU and hospital length of stay was 8-42, 10-42 and 20-60 days respectively. Conclusion: Critically ill Covid-19 patients with ARDS treated with therapeutic plasma exchange followed by convalescent plasma in addition to standard therapy showed improvements in clinical, laboratory, and virological parameters. Although this uncontrolled limited case series had very good success rate, further evaluation in clinical trials is necessary in order to corroborate the findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Laser surgery is recommended before 26 weeks of gestation. However, the optimal management in case of late TTTS (occurring after 26 weeks of gestation) is yet to be established. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies complicated by late TTTS according to different management options (expectant, laser therapy, amnioreduction, or delivery). The primary outcome was mortality, including single and double intrauterine, neonatal, and perinatal death. Secondary outcomes were composite morbidity, neuromorbidity, respiratory distress syndrome, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, intact survival (ie, free from neurological complications), and preterm birth before <32 weeks of gestation. Outcomes were reviewed according to the management and reported for the overall population of twins and disease status (ie, donor and recipient separately). Random-effect meta-analyses of proportions were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Nine studies including 796 twin pregnancies affected by TTTS were included. No randomized controlled trials were available for inclusion. TTTS occurred at ≥26 weeks of gestation in 8.7% (95% CI 6.9%-10.9%; 67/769) of cases reporting TTTS at all gestations. Intrauterine death occurred in 17.7% (95% CI 4.9%-36.2%) of pregnancies managed expectantly, 5.3% (95% CI 0.9%-12.9%) of pregnancies treated with laser, and 0% (95% CI 0%-9%) after amnioreduction. Neonatal death occurred in 42.5% (95% CI 17.5%-69.7%) of pregnancies managed expectantly, in 2.8% (95% CI 0.3%-7.7%) of cases treated with laser, and in 20.2% (95% CI 6%-40%) after amnioreduction. Only one study (10 cases) reported data on immediate delivery after diagnosis with no perinatal deaths. Perinatal death incidence was 55.7% (95% CI 31.4%-78.6%) in twin pregnancies managed expectantly, 5.6% (95% CI 0.5%-15.3%) in those treated with laser, and 20.2% (95% CI 6%-40%) in those after amnioreduction. Intact survival was reported in 44.4%, 96.4%, and 78% of fetuses managed expectantly, with laser or amnioreduction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence regarding perinatal mortality and morbidity in twin pregnancies complicated by late TTTS according to the different managements was of very low quality. Therefore further high-quality research in this field is needed to elucidate the optimal management of these pregnancies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In Uganda, approximately 20,000 children are born with SCA annually (Ndeezi G, 2016). Sickle brain vasculopathy causes both overt strokes and clinically “silent infarcts,” affecting neurological and cognitive function (DeBaun MR, 2012). Incidence of strokes has markedly decreased through standardized preventative measures. Study objectives are to determine the age‐related spectrum and burden of brain injury associated with SCA in Ugandan children, determine predisposing risk factors and build capacity to support interventions for stroke prevention. Here we present preliminary results. Methods: BRAIN SAFE is a cross‐sectional study of a random sample of 250 children with SCA, ages 1‐12 years, who receive care at the Mulago Hospital SCD clinic in Kampala.Potential participants were randomly selected from the clinic roster. Study exclusion criteria: hemoglobinopathy other than HbSS or HbS B thalassemia, age >12, acute illness, Hb <6.0gm/dl, recent transfusion, participation in another clinical study. Stroke history and examination: were performed using the pediatric NIH Stroke Scale. Psychometric testing: Age‐appropriate KABC‐II, TOVA, BRIEF and Mullen testing were performed by skilled testers using validated versions in English or the predominant local language. Transcranial doppler ultrasounds (TCDs) were performed (with good inter‐operator reliability) by two study staff, both health professionals. They had been trained by a U.S.‐based “STOP” trial TCD research nurse and a co‐investigator who had TCD training in the U.S. The latter also performed standardized readings (Adams RJ, 1998). Quality assurance for TCD readings was provided by an independent stroke neurologist. Brain Magnetic imaging (MRI/MRA): Using a single 1.5T scanner, a subset of subjects enriched for a history of stroke, abnormal neurological exam and/or cognitive testing. Two radiologists performed clinical reads. An independent neuroradiologist assessed sickle vasculopathy, per “SWiTCH” protocol (Helton KJ, 2014), blinded to clinical and radiological data. Primary and secondary stroke prevention: Subjects with persistently non‐normal TCDs on repeat testing or vasculopathy on MRI/MRAswill be offered hydroxyurea. Results: Of the 248 participants screened in the 1st funding year, 233 were enrolled (mean age 5.62 years (range 1‐12). Study exclusions due to age >12, acute illness, severe anemia, recent transfusion or participation in another study. History and neurological exam: Overall, 7 of 233 had history consistent with a stroke, and an abnormal neurological exam, 5 had a history consistent with stroke but a normal neurological exam, 6 had abnormal neurological findings but no history of stroke (total abnormal 18/233, 7.7%). Psychometrics: To date, cognitive test data results have been performed on 80 children; 30 (37.5%) were impaired with varying severity. (Full reports to follow.) TCDs: A total of 224 non‐imaging TCDs have been performed. Using standard criteria, 190 were normal, 4 abnormal (1.8%), and 30 conditional (13.4%). Repeat TCDs have been performed on 13 of those with non‐normal reads and so far, 2 were abnormal, 6 conditional, 4 normal,1 had difficult windows. MRI/MRAs: A subset of 29 subjects were selected with more clinical and/or historical stroke pathology (N= 25, 86%) and have undergone MR imaging to date (see Table). Mean age was 7.1 years (range 3‐12); male: 55%. Of 26 with clinical radiological reads, 16/26 (61.5%) were abnormal. To date, scans from 12 subjects have had SCD vascular reads: 2 had no vasculopathy; 10 were abnormal: 6 with infarcts and arterial stenoses, 3 with infarcts only, 1 with bilateral stenoses only. Conclusions: BRAIN SAFE, a Kampala‐based cross‐sectional study, has already enrolled and completed a large proportion of study procedures. Considerable brain pathology has been identified in all aspects tested, with high prevalence of abnormal history or physical findings, abnormal psychometrics, abnormal cerebral blood flow and/or brain MR imaging. Completion of enrollment and testing for the target sample will provide baseline data for longitudinal assessment and intervention.

Children with SCD are at risk for serious complications such as vaso-occlusive pain crises, cerebral vascular accidents, acute chest syndrome, severe anemia related to aplastic and splenic sequestration crises, infection, and multiorgan failure. Despite years of study, little progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of SCD. For this reason, management has been primarily focused on treating the negative sequelae of the disease. However, exciting ongoing research has led to great improvements not only in the understanding of the disease, but also in what was once considered routine therapy for SCD. Research on the use of modalities such as inhaled nitric oxide, L-arginine therapy, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and the development of blood transfusion programs are making strides in reducing morbidity and mortality, and in improving the quality of life for children with SCD. Perhaps most exciting are the advances in bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, which offer hope of an eventual cure for this debilitating and deadly disease. Advanced practice nurses play a pivotal role in coordinating care for these critically ill children. Knowledge of both current and investigational therapies allows the advanced practice nurse to provide comprehensive, state-of-the-art care to children with life-threatening complications of SCD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) are an especially heterogeneous group. Determining which patients benefit most from a more aggressive approach is extremely important. Purpose: The objective is to apply already validated risk scores in a population of patients admitted for NSTEACS and determine which risk score is best in predicting mortality. Methods: A retrospective study of patients admitted to a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of NSTEACS was performed. Clinical, analytical and imaging parameters were evaluated. The following risk scores were applied: the TIMI score (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), the PURSUIT score (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin), the GRACE score (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and the FRISC score (Fast Revascularisation in Instability in Coronary disease). ROC curves were performed to ascertain the relationship between the risks scores and in-hospital mortality and at one-year follow-up. Results: The study population included 628 patients, 66.6% male patients with a mean age of 71.4±12 years. Mean values for each risk score were determined: GRACE 142±42, TIMI 3±1, PURSUIT 14±3 and FRISC 3±1. The overall in-hospital mortality was 7.0% and at one-year follow-up 5.5%. The following ROC curve in the picture was obtained. Regarding in-hospital mortality, statistical significance was only found with the GRACE (AUC 0.908, p<0.001) and the PURSUIT (AUC 0.711, p=0.009) risk score, but not with the FRISC (AUC 0.580, p=0.320) or the TIMI (AUC 0.435, p=0.421) scales. Concerning mortality at one-year follow-up, the following results were obtained: TIMI (AUC 0.703, p=0.054), FRISC (AUC 0.784, p=0.007), PURSUIT (AUC 0.867, p=0.001) and GRACE (AUC 0.915, p<0.001). Conclusions: Even though all of these scores were developed for short-term prognosis, only the GRACE and the PURSUIT scores performed well in predicting poor in-hospital mortality. However, when evaluating mortality at one-year follow-up, all of the risk scores showed better results. The GRACE score was the best risk score at predicting a poorer prognosis, followed by the PURSUIT and the FRISC scores. The TIMI score was not capable of predicting mortality.

Conventional coagulation tests (CCTs) in cirrhotic patients assess only procoagulant factors and poor predictors of bleeding risk. However CCTs are routinely used prior to invasive procedures and attempts are made to correct these abnormalities before corrective procedures. These practices are not backed by evidences even may be harmful to patients. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a promising tool in evaluating the coagulation status of a cirrhotic patient prior to intervention and hence TEG guided transfusion can avoid unnecessary blood product transfusion to the patients. Methods: This preliminary prospective study included 33 cirrhotic patients undergoing central line placement in the speciality medical ICU of SMS Medical College and Hospital, jaipur. Conventional coagulation tests (CCTs), thromboplastin generation time (TGT) and Thromboelastography (TEG) were done in all patients and they were observed for postprocedural bleeding. None of the patients received prophylactic transfusion before the procedure Results: Of the 33 cirrhotic patients (mean age of 45 yrs, 90.9% males)with 90.9% and 9.1% patients in child class, B, C. All patients underwent central line placement. Bleeding time, clotting time and TGT were normal in all patients. None of the 33 patients developed clinically significant bleeding.Comparison of TEG paramaters (R time and MA)with INR and platelet counts showed stastically significant lower percentage of abnormal values of R time and MA value compared to INR and platelet count in patients with no post procedural bleed. Conclusion: Abnormal CCTS in patients with cirrhosis do not predict bleeding risk. Instead of CCTs guided assessment, TEG guided cogulopathy assessment in cirrhotics provides an unique oppurtnunity for rationale transfusion practices in cirrhotic patients prior to invasive procedures like central line placement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes identified patients presenting with UGIB requiring endoscopy. All patients were risk stratified by using the AIMS65, Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS), pre-endoscopy Rockall, and full Rockall scores. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were a composite endpoint of inpatient mortality, rebleeding, and endoscopic, radiologic, or surgical intervention; blood transfusion requirement; intensive care unit (ICU) admission; rebleeding; and hospital length of stay. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for each score. Results Of the 424 study patients, 18 (4.2%) died and 69 (16%) achieved the composite endpoint. The AIMS65 score was superior to both the GBS (AUROC, 0.80 vs 0.76, P <.027) and the pre-endoscopy Rockall score (0.74, P =.001) and equivalent to the full Rockall score (0.78, P =.18) in predicting inpatient mortality. The AIMS65 score was superior to all other scores in predicting the need for ICU admission and length of hospital stay. AIMS65, GBS, and full Rockall scores were equivalent (AUROCs, 0.63 vs 0.62 vs 0.63, respectively) and superior to pre-endoscopy Rockall (AUROC, 0.55) in predicting the composite endpoint. GBS was superior to all other scores for predicting blood transfusion. Conclusion The AIMS65 score is a simple risk stratification score for UGIB with accuracy superior to that of GBS and pre-endoscopy Rockall scores in predicting in-hospital mortality and the need for ICU admission.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A closed (no cardiotomy reservoir), with kinetic (kinetic energy derived from main centrifugal pump via Venturi effect on venous line) assist primed vent, mini CPB circuit was used. On cannulation a patient prime displacement technique was employed to achieve cardiac decompression then full CPB was commenced. Clinical data were collected prospectively from these patients undergoing CABG (n = 20) and compared to all matched patients undergoing CABG with standard CPB (Control, n = 215) during the same time period. Emergency and redo-CABG procedures were excluded from the control group. Results: The 30-day mortality for both groups was low (mini-bypass 0% vs control 1.16%, P = ns). The incidence of postoperative renal failure, respiratory failure and low cardiac output syndrome was higher in the Control Group with resulting prolonged ICU stay. The postoperative mean blood transfusion requirement was higher for the Control Group (0.85 ± 2.0) compared to the mini Group 0.25 ± 0.63 (P = 0.03). The mean units of intraoperative blood usage was also higher in the conventional group (0.40 ± 0.91). Conclusions: The use of closed miniaturized cardiopulmonary bypass circuit combined with a prime displacement technique required a lower transfusion of blood and blood products along with a reduced postoperative complication rate when compared with patients on conventional CPB circuits undergoing CABG. This along with the shortened ICU stay resulted in reduced overall cost of the procedure. The safety, utility and effectiveness of the mini CPB technique has stimulated the embarkation of a 200-case trail and the development and introduction of a para-corporeal vacuum assisted drainage low prime circuit with applications for a wide range of cardiac surgical interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We present our data and experience over the last 8 years in managing such patients. BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data on management and outcomes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who do not accept blood-derived products. STUDY: We performed a retrospective study of patients from 2003 to 2011 presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding who do not accept blood-derived products. Inclusion criteria were either overt bleeding with a presenting hemoglobin (Hb) of <12 g/dL or a decrease in Hb of >1.5 g/dL. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients who met the inclusion criteria were included. Forty-one upper and 48 lower gastrointestinal bleeding sources were identified. Mean Hb was 8.8 g/dL and mean nadir was 6.9 g/dL. Among 37 patients (80.5%) with Hb ≤6.0 g/dL, 30 (81%) survived. Four of 7 patients (57%) with a Hb <3 g/dL survived. The overall mortality rate was 10.4%. In unadjusted logistic regression models, age [1.06 (1.01-1.12 y)], admission to ICU [6.37(1.27-31.9)], and anticoagulation use [6.95 (1.57-30.6)] were associated with increased mortality. Initial Hb [0.68 (0.51-0.92)] and nadir Hb [0.48 (0.29-0.78)] inversely predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transfusion-free management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be effective with mortality comparable with the general population accepting medically indicated transfusion. Management of these patients is challenging and requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team approach knowledgeable in techniques of blood conservation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We sought to determine whether a predictive model could be constructed that would serve as a useful decision support tool for the pre-emptive management of intensive care unit (ICU)-related anemia. METHODS: Our cohort consisted of all ICU patients (n = 5,170) admitted to a large tertiary-care academic medical center during the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. We divided the cohort into development (n = 3,619) and validation (n = 1,551) sets. Using a set of demographic and physiologic variables available within six hours of ICU admission, we developed models to predict patients who either received late transfusion or developed late anemia. We then constructed a point system to quantify, within six hours of ICU admission, the likelihood of developing late anemia. RESULTS: Models showed good discrimination with receiver operating characteristic curve areas ranging from 0.72 to 0.77, although predicting late transfusion was consistently less accurate than predicting late anemia. A five-item point system predicted likelihood of late anemia as well as existing clinical trial inclusion criteria but resulted in pre-emptive intervention more than two days earlier. CONCLUSION: A rule-based decision support tool using information available within six hours of ICU admission may lead to earlier and more appropriate use of blood-sparing strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, these cohort studies did not adjust for disease severity during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study using prospectively collected data from March 1, 1993, through February 28, 2005. A cohort of 3037 consecutive surgical cases requiring intensive care therapy for more than one day was analyzed. We used two different sets of potentially confounding covariables (admission variables only or in combination with variables reflecting number and extent of organ dysfunction during ICU stay). We found that the total number of red cell units which a case had received during ICU stay, and the maximum number of units given on a single day, were independently associated with an increase in ICU mortality when only admission variables were considered for the analysis. After controlling for the additional effect of variables reflecting organ dysfunction during ICU stay, we found that red cell transfusion was no longer an independent risk factor for death. However, there was a significant effect of red cell transfusion on ICU LOS in survivors irrespective of the covariable sets used. We conclude that red cell transfusion during ICU stay may be only a surrogate marker for disease severity and is not causally related to ICU mortality. Relevant side effects of red cell transfusion are presumably small and may be only recognizable in surviving cases. ©2007The Shock Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Shodai""=>[""こちらは、対象が術後患者なので、除外でしょうか？""], ""Takahiro""=>[""ご指摘の通り、術後患者でした。吉廣先生の判断に賛成です。""]}",,"",,

manifests as hyperinflammation and life-threatening multiple organ failure. However, the clinical manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis and fulminant cytokine storm caused by HLH macrophage activation are very similar and difficult to distinguish. HLH triggered by two novel gene defects manifesting with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and distributive shock has not been reported. A 14-year-old male patient was hospitalized with a high fever, his condition deteriorated rapidly, accompanied by cytopenia, shock, and MODS, and he was subsequently transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) for symptomatic and organ-supportive treatments. Laboratory indicators of cytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, high soluble CD25, low natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis of HLH. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that two novel heterozygous gene mutations in AP3B1 (c.3197 C > T) and ATM (c.8077 G > T) might have accounted for the onset. After treatment, the patient’s condition successfully improved. This case report demonstrates the timely determination of underlying triggers and critical care supports (supportive and etiological treatment) of HLH related to the improved outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Identifying risk factors and developing a prognostic model for GNB might improve the survival rate. In this observational and real-world study, we retrospectively analyzed the risk factors and outcomes of GNB in malignant patients. Multivariable regression was used to identify risk factors for the incidence of GNB, while Cox regression analysis was performed to identify significant prognostic factors. A prognostic model was constructed based on Cox regression analysis and presented on a nomogram. ROC curves, calibration plots, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to estimate the model. It comprised 1004 malignant patients with Bloodstream infection (BSI) in the study cohort, 65.7% (N = 660) acquired GNB. Multivariate analysis showed gynecologic cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, and genitourinary cancer were independent risk factors related to the incidence of GNB. Cox regression analysis raised that shock, admission to ICU before infection, pulmonary infection, higher lymphocyte counts, and lower platelet counts were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS). The OS was significantly different between the two groups classified by optimal cut-off value (log-rank, p < 0.001). Above all, a nomogram was created based on the prognostic model, which was presented on a website freely. This real-world study was concentrated on the malignant patients with GNB and proved that shock, admission to ICU before infection, pulmonary infection, higher lymphocyte counts, and lower platelet counts were related to the death of these patients. And a prognostic model was constructed to estimate the risk score of mortality, further to reduce the risk of death.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This coincidence may result from an increased prevalence of both the diseases in elderly patients. In this study, COPD, which is known to be associated with a variety of comorbidities, and its potential interactions, eg, mediated via systemic inflammation, are discussed. The purpose of the present study was to identify the role of COPD as an independent risk factor for complications after total knee and hip arthroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a monocentric patient cohort of 2,760 arthoplasties, propensity score matching was done using the following factors: sex, age, replaced joint, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, body mass index, hypertension, chronic heart disease, anticoagulation, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal deficiency, and actual smoking status to create 224 pairs. Both the pre-matched differences and the results after propensity score matching were statistically analyzed with p≤0.05 being defined as statistically significant. RESULTS: All confounders were eliminated after matching. Preoperatively measured C-reactive protein and leukocytes were higher in the COPD group (p<0.001; p=0.01, respectively). Intensive care unit admission was higher for COPD patients (p=0.023). Pneumonia occurred in patients with COPD only (p=0.024). There was a trend (not significant) toward a higher rate of wound infections, increased transfusion of red blood cells, and a prolonged hospital stay in patients with COPD. CONCLUSION: COPD was associated with an increased length of hospital stay, a higher risk of pneumonia and wound infection, higher general complications, and an increased need for red blood cell transfusion. It is thus recommended to enhance the implementation of pneumonia prevention programs on surgical wards.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases from April 9, 2021, to May 22, 2022. Demographic data and laboratory findings were extracted from patients' electronic medical records on the first day of admission to the hospital. All patients were followed up for outcomes related to COVID-19 including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality rate. Results: Of 760 confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases, 362, 298, and 100 represented patients during waves 4–6, respectively. During the Omicron wave, hospitalized patients were older than the other two waves and had a lower median level of C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The median length of hospital stay during waves 4–6 was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.0–8.0), 7 days (IQR: 6.0–11), and 6 days (IQR: 5.0–9.0), respectively (p < 0.001). The rate of ICU admission during waves 4–6 significantly increased. Conclusions: Although the Omicron variant caused less severe disease, in older patients who were hospitalized due to Omicron infection, longer hospital and ICU stays were reported, which could be attributed to their old age. In particular, elderly patients are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19; otherwise, as expected, other laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes were in accordance with differences in pathogenicity and infectivity of these variants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, recent consensus statements and clinician surveys support consideration in patients with favorable disease prognosis and reversible conditions causing respiratory or cardiac failure. Descriptions of patient, chemotherapeutic, and disease characteristics within patients in these populations undergoing ECMO have been lacking as the published literature is limited to registry reports and small multicenter retrospective studies. The Hematology and Oncology Pediatric Patients on ECMO (HOPPE) study working group aims to further investigate characteristics that predict improved outcomes and complications within these patient populations. Methods: Data were obtained from an international, multi-center, retrospective chart review. We included patients ≤ 18 years of age with active or history of cancer, HLH, or who received a HCT prior to or during ECMO support. Data collected included pre-ECMO disease characteristics (diagnosis, disease status at time of cannulation, chemotherapy/therapeutics received prior to and during ECMO), HCT conditioning regimen and engraftment date. ECMO run data including reason for ECMO cannulation, cannulation configuration, ECMO complications, laboratory data, bleeding events and transfusion data. Severity of illness and functional status scores were collected for this study cohort. Results: A total of 180 patients from 15 centers were included in the study. Subgroups analyzed included those with oncologic diagnosis (n = 140), HLH (n = 30), and HCT (n = 29). Median age was 6 years (2,12). Median ECMO duration was 6 (3,13) days for the entire cohort and was similar for the HCT and HLH subsets. Overall ECMO survival was 54% for the entire cohort, 55% for oncologic, 60% for HLH, and 66% for HCT subgroups. VA-ECMO (55%) was utilized more frequently than VV-ECMO (45%). Median ICU length of stay was 22 (9,44) days with a median hospital length of stay of 38 (15,70) days for the entire cohort. The HCT subgroup had an overall longer length of stay to both ICU discharge (28 days; IQR 20,61) and to hospital discharge (81 days; IQR 42,112). Conclusion: This is the largest multicenter, retrospective review to describe patient characteristics and ECMO survival in pediatric oncology, HLH, and HCT patients. Survival in the oncologic subgroup was similar to data reported in pediatric ECMO populations for other disease processes. The HOPPE study results will help define the factors that improve outcomes and improve access to ECMO in this patient population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A 14-month (from November 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007) prospective observational study of a group of 43 patients admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit in First Affiliated Hospital (tertiary hospital) of Guangzhou Medical College meeting the criteria for severe pneumonia and septic shock was carried out. Implementation of 6-hour and 24-hour bundle treatment for severe infection was divided into three phases consisting of education, trial, and application. A cohort of 43 patients with matched disease history admitted during January 1, 2004 to October 31, 2006 were enrolled as control group. Results: 1 In 6-hour bundle treatment for severe infection, 20.9% (9/43) had serum lactate meassured, blood culture was obtained prior to antibiotic administration in 7.0% (3/43) of patients, 100% (43/43) had empirical antibiotics administration within 1 hour, an injusion of an initial minimum of 20 ml/kg of crystalloid or colloid equivalent (1.1 ml/ kg of 20% albumin or 4.8 ml/kg of 6% hydroxyethyl starch) was given in 44.2% (19/43), with infused fluid (converted into 6% hydroxyethyl starch) reaching (503.95 ± 176.19) ml within 6 hours, in 94.7% (18/19) of patients had received vasopressors, and inotropic dobutamine and/or transfusion of packed red blood cells were administered in 7.0% (3/43). 2 In 24-hour bundle treatment for severe infection group, 31.6% (6/19) had received low-dose steroids, 34.9% (15/43) had their blood glucose controlled<8.3 mmol/L, mechanical ventilation with inspiratory plateau pressures maintained <30 cm H2O (1 cm H2O=0.098 kPa, 6 ml/kg tidal volume) was instituted in 97.6% (40/41) of patients. 3 The percentage of compliance with 6-hour and 24-hour bundle treatment for severe infection were 0 and 21.4% respectively, total compliance was also 0. 4 As compared with control group, a 23.30% absolute mortality reduction was found in bundle group (18.6% vs. 41.9%, P = 0.019). Conclusion: Bundle treatment for severe infection is complied with partially in our hospital, suggesting that it is still quite arduous to popularize guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock in our country.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The incidence of stage IV disease decreased by 50 per cent over the course of the study (P < 0.001). Lymph node involvement declined by 30 per cent (P < 0.01). Endoscopy displaced contrast radiography as the primary diagnostic modality. Sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy averaged 92 per cent. Twice as many patients were resected for cure in the current decade compared with the 1970s (P < 0.001). Operative mortality was less than 2.5 per cent for the entire period studied and has been nil in the 1990s. Intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements also decreased significantly each decade. Hospital stay was shortened by 41 per cent and the length of postoperative stay in the intensive care unit decreased from a median of 4 days to zero. Five-year survival improved significantly during the study period, mirrored by an increase in survival for early cancers. We have found an earlier presentation of gastric adenocarcinoma over the past 3 decades that parallels an increased use of endoscopy and an improved sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy. More patients are now resectable than in previous decades. Survival after surgical treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma improved between 1970 and 1996, partially due to an increase in earlier stage lesions. Improved survival is also demonstrable when only early stage cancers are considered.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Results: Serum dabigatran concentration (conc) drawn on admission was 860 ng/mL. Following the initial emergent hemodialysis (HD) procedure, subsequent dabigratan conc. were determined during the second HD procedure. Predialysis and postdialysis dabigatran conc. were 130 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and shown in the table Over the hospital course, patient required regular HD, Hg stabilized following transfusion and vitamin K. Patient was stable on discharge with a serum creatinine of 5.9 mg/dL and remained on dialysis. Conclusions: Dabigatran induced AKI is rare. The mechanism of the insult in this case was unclear but acute blood loss leading to prolonged ischemic insult was largely contributive. Hemodialysis was successful in removing the offending agent with resolution of bleeding but patient remains dialysis dependent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Children receiving greater numbers of RBC transfusions have increased postoperative complications and mortality. Longer RBC storage age is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Whether the association of increased transfusions and worse outcomes can be ameliorated by use of fresh RBCs in pediatric cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease is unknown. INTERVENTIONS: One hundred and twenty‐eight consecutively transfused children undergoing repair or palliation of congenital heart disease with cardiopulmonary bypass who were participating in a randomized trial of washed versus standard RBC transfusions were evaluated for an association of RBC storage age and clinical outcomes. To avoid confounding with dose of transfusions and timing of infection versus timing of transfusion, a subgroup analysis of patients only transfused 1‐2 units on the day of surgery was performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality was low (4.9%) with no association between RBC storage duration and survival. The postoperative infection rate was significantly higher in children receiving the oldest blood (25‐38 d) compared with those receiving the freshest RBCs (7‐15 d) (34% vs 7%; p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis of subjects receiving only 1‐2 RBC transfusions on the day of surgery (n = 74) also demonstrates a greater prevalence of infections in subjects receiving the oldest RBC units (0/33 [0%] with 7‐ to 15‐day storage; 1/21 [5%] with 16‐ to 24‐day storage; and 4/20 [20%] with 25‐ to 38‐day storage; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, RBC storage age and corticosteroid administration were the only predictors of postoperative infection. Washing the oldest RBCs (> 27 d) was associated with a higher infection rate and increased morbidity compared with unwashed RBCs. DISCUSSION: Longer RBC storage duration was associated with increased postoperative nosocomial infections. This association may be secondary in part, to the large doses of stored RBCs transfused, from single‐donor units. Washing the oldest RBCs was associated with increased morbidity, possibly from increased destruction of older, more fragile erythrocytes incurred by washing procedures. Additional studies examining the effect of RBC storage age on postoperative infection rate in pediatric cardiac surgery are warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Liver surgery is one of the effective therapeutic options. Bleeding is a major complication during liver surgery. Perioperative bleeding and allogeneic blood transfusion may deteriorate the prognosis. Terlipressin (TP), a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone, may reduceblood loss during abdominal surgery. Several clinical centres have attempted to use TP during liver surgery, but the evidence for its effectiveness in reducing blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion, as well as its safety during the perioperative period, remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TP in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion needs during liver surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science for studies on perioperative use of TP during liver surgery from inception to July 2023. We will limit the language to English, and two reviewers will independently screen and select articles. The primary study outcomes are estimated blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion. Secondary outcomes include operating time, intensive care unit stay, length of stay, intraoperative urine output, acute kidney injury rate, postoperative complications, hepatic and renal function during follow-up, and TP-related adverse effects. We will include studies that met the following criteria: (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies or case-control studies; (2) the publication time was till July 2023; (3) adult patients (≥18 years old) undergoing elective liver surgery; (4) comparison of TP with other treatments and (5) the study includes at least one outcome. We will exclude animal studies, case reports, case series, non-original articles, reviews, paediatric articles, non-controlled trials, unpublished articles, non-English articles and other studies that are duplicates. We will use Review Manager V.5.3 software for meta-analysis and perform stratification analysis for the study quality of RCTs based on the Jadad score. For cohort or case-control studies, the study quality will be analysed based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation will be used to assess confidence in the cumulative evidence. For primary outcomes, we will conduct subgroup analyses based on meta-regression. We will also perform leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of each individual study on the combined results by removing the individual studies one by one for outcomes with significant heterogeneity. The protocol follows the Cochrane Handbook for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a secondary analysis of existing data; therefore, it does not require ethical approval. We will disseminate the results through peer-reviewed publications.

METHODS: In our intensive care unit (ICU), 55 patients (46 male, median age 61 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (35 = 63.6% on mechanical ventilation, 7 = 14.5% on high-flow nasal oxygen, 12 = 20% on non-invasive ventilation, 1 = 1.8% without respiratory support) were treated with high-titre CP (200 mL per dose, range 1-6 doses, median 3 doses per patient, minimum titre > 1:100, Wantai test). 139 COVID-19 patients treated in the same ICU who did not receive CP served as control group. In 27 patients, the effect of CP on the individual levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was assessed by ELISA in serum sample pairs collected before and after CP transfusion. RESULTS: The first CP dose was administered at a median of 8 days after symptom onset. 13 patients in the plasma cohort died (28-day mortality 24.1%), compared to 42 (30.2%) in the cohort who did not receive CP (p = 0.5, Pearson Chi-squared test). Out of the 27 individuals investigated for the presence of IgG antibodies, 8 did not have detectable IgG levels before the first CP transfusion. In this subpopulation, 3 patients (37.5%) died. Not a single confirmed adverse reaction to CP was noted. CONCLUSIONS: While adjunctive treatment with CP for severe and life-threatening COVID-19 was a very safe intervention, we did not observe any effect on mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

In the control group of 50 patients a blood conservation device was not used, while in the active group of 78 patients the device was used. Use of the blood conservation device did not affect the haemoglobin trends when both groups were compared using the general linear model. For patients with admission haemoglobin ≥115 g/l, use of a blood conservation device does not affect the subsequent rate of haemoglobin decline in the intensive care unit.

Methods: The clinical data of 86 AFLP pregnant women admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from September 2017 to August 2022 were collected, and their general data, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests and maternal and fetal outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Results: (1) General information: the age of the 86 pregnant women with AFLP was (30.8±5.4) years, and the body mass index was (21.0±2.5) kg/m2. There were 50 primiparas (58.1%, 50/86) and 36 multiparas (41.9%, 36/86). There were 64 singleton pregnancies (74.4%, 64/86) and 22 twin pregnancies (25.6%, 22/86). (2) Clinical characteristics: the main complaints of AFLP pregnant women were gastrointestinal symptoms, including epigastric pain (68.6%, 59/86), nausea (47.7%, 41/86), anorexia (46.5%, 40/86), vomiting (39.5%, 34/86). The main non-gastrointestinal symptoms were jaundice of skin and/or scleral (54.7%, 47/86), edema (38.4%, 33/86), fatigue (19.8%, 17/86), bleeding tendency (16.3%, 14/86), polydipsia or polyuria (14.0%, 12/86), skin itching (8.1%, 7/86), and 17.4% (15/86) AFLP pregnant women had no obvious symptoms. (3) Laboratory tests: the incidence of liver and kidney dysfunction and abnormal coagulation function in AFLP pregnant women was high, and the levels of blood ammonia, lactate dehydrogenase and lactic acid were increased, and the levels of hemoglobin, platelet and albumin decreased. However, only 24 cases (27.9%, 24/86) of AFLP pregnant women showed fatty liver by imageology examination. (4) Pregnancy outcomes: ① AFLP pregnant women had a high incidence of pregnancy complications, mainly including renal insufficiency (95.3%, 82/86), preterm birth (46.5%, 40/86), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (30.2%, 26/86), gestational diabetes mellitus (36.0%, 31/86), fetal distress (24.4%, 21/86), pulmonary infection (23.3%, 20/86), disseminated intravascular coagulation (16.3%, 14/86), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (16.3%, 14/86), hepatic encephalopathy (9.3%, 8/86), and intrauterine fetal death (2.3%, 2/86). ② Treatment and outcome of AFLP pregnant women: the intensive care unit transfer rate of AFLP pregnant women was 66.3% (57/86). 82 cases were improved and discharged after treatment, 2 cases were transferred to other hospitals for follow-up treatment, and 2 cases (2.3%, 2/86) died. ③ Neonatal outcomes: except for 2 cases of intrauterine death, a total of 106 neonates were delivered, including 39 cases (36.8%, 39/106) of neonatal asphyxia, 63 cases (59.4%, 63/106) of neonatal intensive care unit admission, and 3 cases (2.8%, 3/106) of neonatal death. Conclusions: AFLP is a severe obstetric complication, which is harmful to mother and fetus. In the process of clinical diagnosis and treatment, attention should be paid to the clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of pregnant women, early diagnosis and active treatment, so as to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Articles reporting this condition in immunocompetent recipients are usually from countries that still have problems in irradiation of blood products. CASE REPORTS: This report presents fatal TA-GVHD in four immunocompetent patients referred from rural areas where blood irradiation is still not the routine procedure to our tertiary-care center between July 2004 and July 2005. A similar history and chronological order of events were observed: fresh whole-blood transfusion from relatives, fever, rash, liver dysfunction, diarrhea, and pancytopenia. Skin biopsies demonstrated Grade II to III GVHD involvement. Marrow biopsies showed hypoplasia. In two cases, HLA typing studies were performed. Donors were homozygous for a shared HLA haplotype in the patients. All cases were admitted to the intensive care unit within 3 weeks after transfusions with the diagnosis of sepsis, which rapidly progressed to septic shock and multiorgan failure. Another common observation was Candida albicans growth in blood cultures. Unfortunately, all died despite prompt and appropriate sepsis treatment, along with immunomodulatory therapy. CONCLUSION: TA-GVHD is probably more prevalent than reported in the literature.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of 2 different regimens in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID‐19: Methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours (low‐dose group) and 1000 mg/day pulse therapy for 3 days following 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone every 12 hours (high‐dose group). Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with mild to moderate ARDS due to COVID‐19 were randomly assigned to receive either low‐dose (n = 47) or high‐dose (n = 48) intravenous methylprednisolone regimens. Two groups were matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophil/lymphocyte, platelet, hemoglobin, and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C‐reactive protein [CRP], and ferritin). Both regimens were initiated upon admission and continued for 10 days. The clinical outcome and secondary complications were evaluated. Results: Evaluating in‐hospital outcomes, no difference was revealed in the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stays (5.4 ± 4.6 vs. 4.5 ± 4.9; P = 0.35), total hospital stays (8 ± 3.1 vs. 6.9 ± 3.4; P = 0.1), requirement rate for invasive ventilation (29.2% vs. 36.2%; P = 0.4) or non‐invasive ventilation (16.6% vs 23.4%; P = 0.4), and hemoperfusion (16.6% vs 11.3%; P = 0.3) between the low‐and high‐dose groups. There was no significant difference in fatality due to ARDS (29.2% vs. 38.3%; P = 0.3) and septic shock (4.2% vs. 6.4%; P = 0.3) between the low‐and high‐dose groups. Patients in the high‐dose group had significantly higher bacterial pneumonia co‐infection events compared with those in the low‐dose group (18.7% vs 10.6%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: The use of adjuvant pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone did not result in improved in‐hospital clinical outcomes among patients with mild to moderate ARDS due to COVID‐19. A higher risk of bacterial pneumonia should be considered in such cases as receiving a higher dose of steroids.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

remains a most concerning complication of cancer chemotherapy. Outside the oncology setting, however, only few data are currently available on febrile neutropenia related to non-chemotherapy drugs. We report here data on 76 patients with febrile neutropenia related to non-chemotherapy drugs, followed up in a referral center within a university hospital. Patients and methods: Data from 76 patients with idiosyncratic drug-induced febrile neutropenia were retrospectively reviewed. All cases were extracted from a cohort study on agranulocytosis conducted at the Strasbourg University Hospital (Strasbourg, France). Results: Mean patient age was 52.2 years old (range: 18-93) and gender ratio (F/M) 1.6, with several comorbidities present in 86.8% of patients. The most common causative drugs were: antibiotics (37.4%), antithyroid drugs (17.2%), neuroleptic and anti-epileptic agents (13.1%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and analgesics (8%), and platelet aggregation inhibitors (8%). Main clinical presentations upon hospitalization included isolated fever (30%), sore throat, acute tonsillitis and sinusitis (18.4%), documented pneumonia (18.4%), septicemia (14.5%), and septic shock (6.6%). Mean neutrophil count at nadir was 0.13 × 10(9)/L (range: 0-0.48). While in hospital, 22 patients (28.9%) worsened clinically and required intensive care unit placement. All patients were promptly treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 45 (59.2%) with hematopoietic growth factors. Mean duration of hematological recovery (neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10(9)/L) was 7.5 days (range: 2-21), which was reduced to 0.7 days (range: 2-16) (p = 0.089) with hematopoietic growth factors. Outcome was favorable in 89.5% of patients, whereas eight died. Conclusions: Like in oncology and myelosuppressive chemotherapy settings, idiosyncratic febrile neutropenia is typically serious, about 40% of patients exhibiting severe pneumonia, septicemia, and septic shock, with a mortality rate of 10%. Like in febrile, chemotherapy-related neutropenia, modern and timely management (immediate broad spectrum antibiotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors) may reduce infection-related mortality. All practitioners should be aware of this potential side-effect that may even occur in the event of “daily medication” exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Reasons for this include concern over the possibility of flap loss and other complications, the time required for these procedures, and the perceived need for a microsurgical team. The results of free tissue transfer in 100 patients in a single practitioner private practice setting were assessed. Charts were reviewed and data recorded including major and minor complications, American Society of Anesthesia rating, operative time, intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, estimated blood loss, and transfusion requirements. Indications included breast reconstruction, the management of chronic wounds, and acute trauma. There were three complete flap losses and three partial flap losses. There were 22 major complications in 21 patients and 17 minor complications. The results of this study compare favorably with those compiled from 36 prior report s. Free tissue transfer has taken its place in the reconstructive armamentarium as the procedure of choice in many reconstructive situations due to its reliability and versatility. This form of reconstruction can be safely offered to patients in any practice situation by surgeons who are trained in and comfortable with free tissue transfer techniques.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with CCAF in Guangdong Cardiovascular Institute between January 2002 and December 2017. Patients who were qualified into our criteria were included into final analysis. The rate of successful closure and complications during hospitalization and at follow-up were compared between SC and TCC groups. Results: In total, 121 pediatric patients (male, n = 69; female, n = 52) with CCAF were divided to TCC (n = 63) and SC groups (n = 58) according to the indications. The mean age was 5.3 ± 1.4 years. The baseline characteristics of these two groups were similar except for the fistula anatomic feature. After adjusted for the fistula anatomy, compared to SC, TCC was associated with higher risk of major complications (p = 0.013). Proportions of patients requiring blood transfusion and intra-operative blood loss were higher in SC versus TCC groups, as were longer duration of hospital and ICU stay during hospitalization. In contrast, myocardial ischemia (10.2% vs 0.0%, p = 0.028), residual shunts (16.9% vs 3.6%, p = 0.045) and new-onset moderate-to-severe valve regurgitation (11.9% vs 0.0%, p = 0.013) were higher in TCC group versus SC groups during follow-up. Conclusions: TCC has less invasive and faster recovery. However, SC had a higher successful rate and lower risk of major complications in pediatric patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively during the study period. The main outcome measures were whether or not patients were transfused with red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product, the proportion of patients returned to theatre for investigation for post-operative bleeding and length of stay in the intensive care unit. We performed univariate analysis to identify the factors influencing the outcome measures and multivariate analysis to identify the effect of administration of tranexamic acid on the outcome measures. RESULTS: Administration of tranexamic acid was an independent factor affecting the transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product. It was also an independent factor influencing the rate of return to theatre for exploration of bleeding. The odds of receiving a transfusion or returning to theatre for bleeding were significantly lower in patients receiving tranexamic acid. The administration of tranexamic acid also significantly decreased blood loss. We did not find any association between the administration of tranexamic acid and the length of intensive care stay. CONCLUSION: Based on the analysis of 4191 patients who underwent a primary cardiac operation, administration of tranexamic acid decreased the number of patients exposed to a transfusion or returned to theatre for bleeding in our institute.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical outcome and quality of life of patients subjected to TF-TAVI and open surgical aortic valve replacement through partial upper mini sternotomy (PUMS-SAVR). METHODS: Baseline, procedural and post-treatment data of 197 consecutive patients: 137 TF-TAVI and 60 PUMS-SAVR treated at Philipps University of Marburg, were retrospectively collected. The propensity score method was used to create two groups in a 1:1 fashion. Questionnaire assessment (SF36_LQ) of quality of life of the matched patients was carried out at the ambulant routine control presentation. A competing risk regression model is used to evaluate the impact of the clinical outcome on health-related quality of life (HrQoL). RESULTS: After propensity matching, TF-TAVI remained associated with lower procedural time (136±50 vs. 298±36 min, P<0.01), intensive care unit stay (2.68±2.70 vs. 4.29±2.43 days, P<0.01), transfusion of packed red cell units (0.46±2.05 vs. 1.60±2.00 U, P=0.02) and higher heart block (42.86% vs. 0%, P<0.01) and permanent pacemaker implantation rates (14.29% vs. 0%, P=0.05) compared to PUMS-SAVR. TF-TAVI is associated with less complains, superior HrQoL (excellent 40% and very good 60% vs. very good 100% in PUMS). Partial sternotomy is the main predictor of the inferior HrQoL, with the regression coefficient of -1.11 (95% confidential interval, -1.503 to -0.726; R(2)=0.324, P<0.0001). Transfusion (P=0.26), paravalvular leakage (0.618), pacemaker implantation (P=0.19) and delirium (P=0.92) did not influence HrQoL after the minimal-invasive treatment of aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although PUMS-SAVR offers better technical outcomes with less permanent pacemaker implantation and less paravalvular leakage than TF-TAVI, it is still associated with more need for transfusion, longer ventilation-and intensive care unit-times, and prolonged hospital stay. In the elderly, PUMS-SAVR achieves inferior quality of life compared to TF-TAVI. Partial sternotomy reveals as the strongest risk factor of perceived health-level post-treatment. It remains to be revealed whether fast-track open heart surgery that maintains a fully intact sternum and allows immediate postoperative extubation-as performed through video-assisted mini-thoracotomy or thoracoscopic robotic procedures with percutaneous cannulation - should be favored against PUMS-SAVR.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary 16-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-three pediatric patients (range 6M to 22 yr) who underwent 176 liver transplantations and were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for at least 48 h. RESULTS: A total of 180 infectious episodes (IE) occurred in 78 (59%) patients who underwent 96 (54.5%) liver transplantations (1.35 IE/patient; 1.02 IE/transplantation). The mean stay was 15.4 +/- 1.1 d (mean +/- SD) and 22 patients died in the pediatric intensive care unit. One hundred and thirty-one IE (72.8%) were bacterial, 31 (17.2%) fungal, and 14 (7.8%) mixed bacterial and fungal. 39% of the IE appeared in the first postoperative week and 27% in the second postoperative week. The most common sites of infection were abdomen (48.3%) and blood stream (26.1%). Bacteria, alone or with fungi, were present in 145 IE (1.1 IE/patient). Gram-positive aerobic bacteria (63%) predominated over gram-negative bacteria (54%) and fungi. Fungi were present in 45 IE; 53.4% of the infections occurred in lung (73% yeasts). The risk factors for infection that were identified were related with younger age, lower body weight, longer cold ischemia time, partial graft, and the volume of packed red blood cell transfusions. Infected patients had more postoperative complications and longer stay in the PICU (21 +/- 16 vs. 8 +/- 6 d), but no increase in mortality. The risk of infection increased 2.38 times with partial grafts and 1.1 times with each intraoperative transfusion of 20 ml/kg of packed red blood cells (RBC). CONCLUSIONS: Infection in the immediate postoperative period of pediatric OLT was related with a high morbidity but was not related significantly with increased mortality. The main risk factors for infection in the postoperative period of OLT were related essentially with small recipient size and the inherent complexity of the operation. Routine oropharyngeal decontamination is recommended, as well as early administration of oral nystatin in preoperative intestinal decontamination. The risk of infection increased 2.38 times with partial grafts and 1.1 times with the transfusion of every 20 ml of packed RBC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become an alternative method for the treatment of AAA with high-risk comorbidities. Objective: Evaluate the results of EVAR in high-risk patients with large AAA. Material and Method: A prospective study of high-risk patients with large AAA and suitable morphology who underwent EVAR between August 2003 and August 2005 was conducted. The long-term outcomes were observed up to December 2006. The comorbidities, size of aneurysm, types of procedures, operative time, amount of blood loss and transfusion, length of postoperative stay in intensive care unit and hospital, postoperative complications and mortality were analyzed. Results: Eight patients (7 males and 1 female) with the mean age of 71.4 years (range 66-83 years) were included in the present study. The comorbidities were six of compromised cardiac status, one of severe pulmonary disease and one of morbid obesity. The average size of aneurysm was 6.2 ± 0.64 centimetres. One patient also had large bilateral iliac artery aneurysms. Seven patients underwent EVAR with bifurcated aortic stent graft and one proceeded with aorto uni-iliac stent graft. Three patients underwent preoperative coil embolisation into internal iliac arteries when the distal landing zones at the external iliac arteries were considered. The mean estimated blood loss was 369cc and the mean blood transfusion was 0.88 units. There were no perioperative mortality, early graft occlusion, AAA rupture and open conversion in the present study. One patient had cardiac arrest due to upper airway obstruction but with successful treatment. Type II endoleak was observed in one patient and successfully treated by expectant management. One limb of bifurcated stent graft was occluded at the 5th month post EVAR and was successfully treated by artery bypass surgery at both groins. The 3-year primary graft limb patency was 87.5% (7/8).

Methods This prospective observational study was conducted on 476 patients who underwent cardiac surgical procedures from January 2014 to March 2014. Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was defined as serum total bilirubin >2.0mgdL'1. Results The overall incidence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was 25% (119 patients). Patients undergoing valve repair or replacement had the highest incidence of hyperbilirubinemia (36.2%), followed by coronary artery bypass grafting with concomitant valve surgery (34.1%), congenital heart surgery (23.1%), and coronary artery bypass alone (12.7%). Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was associated with increased duration of inotropic support (p=0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p=0.0001), intensive care unit stay (p=0.001), hospital stay (p=0.006), and mortality (p=0.014). The perioperative factors associated with postoperative hyperbilirubinemia were increased preoperative bilirubin level (p<0.0001), preoperative prothrombin time (p<0.0001), cardiopulmonary bypass time (p=0.028), aortic crossclamp time (p=0.004), and blood transfusion units (p=0.0001). Conclusions Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia is common in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and is associated with high hospital mortality. The factors associated with its occurrence are increased preoperative bilirubin level, preoperative prothrombin time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, and blood transfusion units. Persistent hyperbilirubinemia is associated with a worse outcome than early transient hyperbilirubinemia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To identify independent predictors for ARF onset in patients who underwent cervical TSCI without premorbid respiratory diseases and to apply appropriate medical supports based on accurate prediction, a nomogram relating admission clinical information was developed for predicting ARF during acute care period. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical profiles of patients who suffered cervical TSCI and were emergently admitted to Qingdao Municipal Hospital from 2014 to 2020 as the training cohort. Univariate analysis was performed using admission clinical variables to estimate associated factors and a nomogram for predicting ARF occurrence was generated based on the independent predictors from multivariate logistic regression analysis. This nomogram was assessed by concordance index for discrimination and calibration curve with internal-validated bootstrap strategy. Receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to compare the predictive accuracy between the nomogram and the traditional gold standard, which combines neuroimaging and neurological measurements by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An additional 56-patient cohort from another medical center was retrospectively reviewed as the test cohort for external validation of the nomogram. Results: 162 patients were eligible for this study and were included in the training cohort, among which 25 individuals developed ARF and were recorded to endure more complications. Despite the aggressive treatments and prolonged intensive care unit cares, 14 patients insulted with ARF died. Injury level, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade, admission hemoglobin (Hb), platelet to lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil percentage to albumin ratio (NPAR) were independently associated with ARF onset. The concordance index of the nomogram incorporating these predictors was 0.933 in the training cohort and 0.955 in the test cohort, although both calibrations were good. The AUC of the nomogram was equal to concordance index, which presented better predictive accuracy compared with previous measurements using neuroimaging and AIS grade (AUC 0.933 versus 0.821, Delong’s test p < 0.001). Similar significant results were also found in the test cohort (AUC 0.955 versus 0.765, Delong’s test p = 0.034). In addition, this nomogram was translated to a Web-based calculator that could generate individual probability for ARF in a visualized form. Conclusions: The nomogram incorporating the injury level, AIS grade, admission Hb, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, and NPAR is a promising model to predict ARF in patients with cervical TSCI who are absent from previous respiratory dysfunction. This nomogram can be offered to clinicians to stratify patients, strengthen evidence-based decision-making, and apply appropriate individualized treatment in the field of acute clinical care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The objective of this study was to examine the role of anemia and blood transfusion on outcomes in TBI patients. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of all blunt trauma patients with TBI admitted to the ICU from July 1998 to December 2005. Admission and daily ICU blood hemoglobin (hemoglobin) levels and blood transfusions during the first week of hospitalization were measured. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin<9 g/dL occurring on 3 consecutive blood draws. The role of anemia and blood transfusion was investigated using logistic regression adjusting for factors, with p<0.2 from the bivariate analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,150 TBI patients were admitted to the ICU. When both anemia and blood transfusion were included in the full model, blood transfusion was significantly associated with higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19 [95% CI, 1.27, 3.75]; p=0.0044) and more complications (AOR, 3.67 [95% CI, 2.18, 6.17]; p<0.0001), but anemia was not. But when transfusion was not included in the full model, anemia was a significant risk factor for mortality (AOR, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.13, 2.24); p=0.007) and for complications (AOR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.42, 2.70]; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion is associated with significantly worse outcomes in traumatic brain injured patients.

HYPOTHESIS Transfusion of pRBC will result in increased cerebral extraction of oxygen. This effect will be greatest in pRBC stored for a greater length of time. JUSTIFICATION One of the main aims of the intensive management of head injured patients is the prevention of secondary hypoxic or hypotensive insults in the already injured brain. Packed red blood cell transfusions are commonly given to trauma patients suffering anemia (Hgb <100 g/l) secondary to blood loss in order to improve oxygen delivery to vital organs including the brain. Previous studies have shown that the capacity of packed red blood cells (pRBC) to improve oxygen delivery to tissues diminishes with increased time in storage. This storage lesion may improve with time post transfusion; however, this may take many hours. Other studies have shown an association between age of pRBCs transfused and length of stay in trauma patients and mortality in septic ICU patients. Unused old blood is likely to be sent to high volume centers to avoid wasting a precious resource. The effects of 'old' transfused blood have not been subject to rigorous prospective studies and age of blood has not been shown to be causally related to the adverse outcomes mentioned above, hence the need for further studies. The injured brain is uniquely sensitive to further damage. Even a brief secondary insult of either hypotension or hypoxia has been shown to have a significant adverse effect on outcomes including permanent disability and death. Furthermore the measurement of markers of cerebral oxygenation forms part of the standard care of severely head injured patients in this institution giving a unique opportunity to study the effects of blood transfusion in this group of patients. The presence of a storage lesion in pRBCs lasting even a few hours could have a significant impact on the head injured patient. If indeed 'fresh' blood does significantly improve markers of cerebral oxygenation when compared to older blood it could alter clinical practice significantly by placing a priority on transfusing only 'fresh' blood in such patients. The effect of age of pRBCs has never been studied in the head injured population. Donated blood is stored for a maximum of 42 days. The average age of pRBC administered at VGH is 21 days. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of transfusing ""fresh"" (blood stored less than 5 days) versus ""stored"" (blood stored for greater than 20 days) pRBC on cerebral oxygen extraction. We will also evaluate the effect of transfusion of pRBC on cerebral oxygen extraction in patients with traumatic brain injury. RESEARCH METHOD This is a single centre randomized trial in severely head injured patients requiring a blood transfusion. Randomization will be by computer generated random numbers paced in sealed envelopes. Patients would be randomized to receive either blood less than 5 days old or greater than 20 days old. The decision to transfuse and all other intensive care management will be unaltered by enrolment in the study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Aims: To analyze the possible application of the ROTEM/TEG in the study of the alterations in peri-operative coagulation within oncology surgery patients. Materials and methods: Blood samples were taken from 186 patients in peri-operative oncology (urologic 80 and gynaecologic 106). A preoperative study was carried out for all the 186 patients; they were also studied after the operation, once they were in the Intensive Care Unit. ExTEM, in TEM, FibTEm and apTEM were performed and CT, CFT, A10 and CFM were the parameters analyzed. Results: In 173 patients (93%), the CT-INTEM basal and post surgery was normal. In 10 patients (5.3%), the CT-INTEM was lower than the control value taken from basal samples. A10-FIBTEM was above the normal values in 160 (86%) out of the 186 patients in basal samples and in 147 (79%) out of the post-surgery samples. In 15 patients (8%) the A10-FIBTEM was higher than the normal parameters. These results are compatible with the hypercoagulability pattern described in oncology patients through standard methods. No signs of hyperfibrin-olysis were observed in the patients (LI 30 100% normal in all cases). Nevertheless, in 15 patients (8%) out of patients in basal samples and in 34 patients (18.3%) out of the post-surgery samples, the CT-EXTEM basal was higher than normal. Conclusions: ROTEM/TEG may provide extensive information in neoplastic patients before surgery. Prospective studies are needed to define the potential applications of ROTEM/TEG in the management of neoplastic patients before surgery. Those cases with altered post-surgery tests in this study could have taken profit of the transfusion of the specific products if they had followed the results of the ROTEM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Design: Descriptive, prospective. Setting: Clinical investigation, intensive care unit of an university hospital. Patients: 40 consecutive critically ill patients with severe trauma (n = 20) or postoperative complications (n = 20) were studied. 14 patients suffered from sepsis, 12 patients suffered from acute renal failure. Interventions: 12 patients with acute renal failure were continuously hemofiltrated. All patients were on continuous sedation (fentanyl and midazolam) and mechanical ventilation. Measurements: In addition to standard coagulation variables, thrombomodulin (TM), protein C and protein S as well as thrombin/antithrombin III (TAT) plasma concentrations were measured from arterial blood samples using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission (trauma patients) or on the day of diagnosis of sepsis and during the next 4 days. Main results: Throughout the entire investigation period, TM plasma concentrations in patients with sepsis (baseline: 90 ± 25 μg/l, 4th day: 152 ± 28 μg/l) were significantly higher than in non-septic patients (baseline: 60 ± 29 μg/l, 4th day: 42 ± 15 μg/l). 15 of the 40 patients died within or after the end of the investigation period. TM plasma concentrations of survivors were lower (maximum: 63 ± 18 μg/l) than in the non-survivors (maximum: 159 ± 22 μg/l) (p < 0.05). Hemofiltered patients showed higher TM plasma levels, which further increased during the hemofiltration procedure. Protein C and (free) protein S were without significant group differences. TAT plasma levels were elevated above normal in all patients (no group differences). Conclusions: Besides plasmatic and platelet-related coagulation, endothelium-associated coagulation appears to be also important for maintenance of hemostasis. TM plasma concentrations were elevated in all our critically ill patients, particularly when sepsis was evident.

Several methods to conserve blood have been used; reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood (RSMB) has found widespread acceptance, but the efficacy and safety are still debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of RSMB on the use of allogenic blood components and selected complications. Material and methods: Six hundred and twenty-three consecutive cardiac surgery patients in three successive periods, of whom patients in the middle period did not receive RSMB due to manufacturer delivery problems, were evaluated. Patients and procedures were characterized by EuroSCORE. Prospective collected data were: units of transfused allogenic blood, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets, postoperative blood loss and postoperative complications such as dialysis, re-operation due to bleeding, sternal infection and stroke. Length of stay in ICU was used as a general indicator of perioperative complications. Results: The number of patients receiving allogenic blood in periods with RSMB was significantly lower (36.5% versus 54.9%, p<0.005), while no difference was seen in FFP and platelets. The average number of transfused blood units was lower in patients receiving RSMB (2.07 versus 3.41, p=0.029), while FFP (1.34 versus 2.01, p=0.11) and platelets (0.58 versus 0.95, p=0.05) were not statistically significantly different. Postoperative bleeding was lower (759 versus 967 ml, p=0.032) in the periods with RSMB. Conclusion : Patients receiving RSMB were less transfused with allogenic blood and had less postoperative drainage, while the frequency of observed postoperative complications was not different from patients who did not receive RSMB. © The Author(s) 2010.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study was conducted to determine if hemoglobin levels during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) predict postoperative stroke in cardiac surgical patients, independent of transfusion requirements. Methods: Individuals who had sustained a clinical postoperative stroke (cases) were matched 1:2 with controls by age, sex, surgical procedure, and year of operation. In 617 patients, conditional logistic regression was performed to analyze associations between hemoglobin levels before and after CPB, and stroke. Results: After adjustment for potentially confounding vascular risk factors, lower hemoglobin after CPB was associated with a higher risk of stroke, even after adjustment for the amount of packed red blood cells transfused (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.64, per point of lower hemoglobin level; adjusted odds ratio for stroke per higher quartile of packed red blood cells transfused in this model, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.83). Similar associations were not found for hemoglobin concentrations preoperatively nor change in hemoglobin from before to after CPB. A post-CPB hemoglobin level below the median was associated with 37% increased odds of a postoperative stroke occurring (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Lower postoperative hemoglobin levels and higher intraoperative transfusion requirements are each independently associated with a higher risk of stroke.

Saunders,,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the delivery of all health care. In spring of 2020, efforts made to minimize disease transmission including “stay-at-home” orders and the deferral of elective outpatient encounters may have led to later, more acute disease presentations. Aim: Assess the impact of the COVID healthcare shutdown on patients presenting to hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Methods: We compared weekly counts of ED visits and inpatient admissions for GIB between the time periods of March 27-May 7, 2020 (COVID period) and March 27-May 7, 2019 (pre-COVID period) in a large health system comprising academic and community hospitals. We also compared the severity of GIB presentations between periods, using incident rate (IRR) and odds ratios (OR) of “severe” GIB (requiring >4 units of red blood cells, endoscopic therapy, interventional radiology or surgical procedure), ICU admission, or shock, as well as multiple secondary clinical outcomes based on automated extraction of ICD-10 diagnoses as well as manual chart review. Lastly, we looked for effect modification of demographic covariates on any association between year and GIB outcomes. Results: The number of ED visits for GIB was significantly lower in 2020 (534 ED visits) compared to 2019 (904 in 2019; IRR 0.59, 95%CI 0.53-0.66, Figure 1). A greater proportion of ED visits for GIB required an inpatient stay in 2020 (73.6% vs 67.8%, p=0.02). Although the absolute number of inpatient and ICU admissions for GIB in 2020 were fewer, the percentage of visits categorized as severe GIB was significantly higher in 2020 (19.3% vs 14.9%, p=0.03). Average transfusion requirement, the first or extreme values for hemoglobin and lactate, and the proportion diagnosed with shock were statistically worse in the 2020 group. While higher frequency variables (e.g. number of endoscopic procedures with hemostasis intervention, total units of red cells, hospital/ICU lengths of stay) were higher in 2019, those for lower frequency variables of more severe disease, including vasopressor support, intubations, renal replacement therapy and inpatient deaths, were similar. There was a significant interaction between year and race, with non-white patients experiencing greater proportions of severe GIB, and greater absolute counts of shock or ICU admission in 2020 than 2019 (Figure 3). Conclusion: A significantly lower number of ER visits and hospitalizations GIB occurred during the pandemic period compared to the same period the year prior. The severity of pandemic presentations was greater, driven by disproportionately worse outcomes in minorities. During the rest of COVID-19 and future pandemics, it is critical to maintain standards of care for non-COVID conditions, with a particularly eye to racial equity.

The 14 cases of MIDCAB were divided into two groups, Group L consisting of 6 low risk cases: 1 lesion alone without any complications involving other organ before operation and Group H made up of 8 high risk cases: multi branch lesion but rated as high risk because of the extracorporeal circulation being used. Both Group L and Group H were free of operation death and hospital death. In Group L, all the cases underwent operation without blood transfusion, the period of postoperative stay in ICU was not longer than 1 day, on catecholamine was required after operation and complications were not found either. The patency of the graft was 100 percent. The patients were discharged 13.7 days after operation. In Group H, 2 cases required blood transfusion and 3 cases required catecholamine after operation. Complication arising from operative wound were noted in 3 cases. One GEA graft to the right coronary artery and one LITA to the LAD buried in the muscle were occluded. After operation, hospital stay for 23.9 days was required. In Group L, the postoperative course was excellent, so MIDCAB was considered indicated well for this group.

We wanted to establish reasons for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and treatment as well as outcome in subjects who required invasive mechanical ventilation. We were also interested in differences between ICU survivors and non-survivors at the moment of admission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients (21 women and 19 men) were included in the study. Median of age was 42 (range 16-73) years. All patients required mechanical ventilation. We analysed age, gender, disease character (acute/chronic), diagnosed pneumonia, multiple organ failure (MOF), history of bone marrow transplantation, peripheral blood parameters (leukocyte, neutrocyte, erythrocyte and thrombocyte counts, haemoglobin level and haematocrit), mean arterial pressure (obtained through direct measurement), necessity of catecholamine administration and symptoms of the acute renal insufficiency at the moment of ICU admission. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of patients died in ICU. Intergroup comparisons between survivors and non-survivors revealed statistically significant differences in the presence of neutropenia, thrombocyte count, mean arterial pressure and the necessity of catecholamines administration, as well as scores obtained through patient evaluation according to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the New Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) scales. Multivariate logistic regression revealed only one independent risk factor for ICU mortality in the analysed group--SAPS II score (p=0.009). Calculated value of the unitary odds ratio was 1.065 (95% confidence interval 1.017-1.116). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality of patients with haematological malignancies requiring intensive mechanical ventilation remains high. Scoring with the SAPS II system was a useful tool for determination of ICU mortality risk in those patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: The study enrolled 80 patients, clinically and radiolodically diagnosed as community‐acquired pneumonia, admitted to Chest department, Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, General Medicine Department and General Medicine Intensive Care Unit of Zagazig University Hospitals. Sixty of them were randomized to receive hydrocortisone as a bolus dose of 200mg intravenously once (only at day 1) then 10mg/h IV infusion for 7days and twenty received placebo, along with antibiotics according to IDSA/ATS 2007 guidelines which were given for both groups. The following parameters were compared in both groups; PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, length of hospital stay, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning success from mechanical ventilation, pneumonia complication and hospital outcome. Results: Hydrocortisone treated patients showed a significant improvement in PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, a significant reduction in White blood cell count, C‐reactive protein levels, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, pneumonia complications, and length of hospital stay. Also there was an improvement of hospital outcome, weaning success from mechanical ventilation and radiological resolution compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: Adjunctive 7. day course of low dose hydrocortisone IV in patients with CAP hastens clinical recovery and prevents the development of sepsis‐related complications with a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of IV antibiotics and length of hospital stay with the improvement in hospital outcome and weaning success from mechanical ventilation. © 2013.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Psychological evaluation was performed through the administration of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL90) and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase), ferritin, CRPhs (C-high sensitivity Reactive Protein), NLR (Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), PLR (Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio), and SII (systemic immune-inflammation index) were investigated. We highlighted that beyond the first three months after contagion, patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection are characterized by the persistence of a systemic inflammatory state and are at high risk for developing somatization, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Interestingly, ferritin value was strongly correlated with sleep disorders (p < 0.05). Our study emphasizes how COVID-19 strategies for risk stratification, prognosis, and therapy management of patients should be implemented with a psychological follow-up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Therefore, we investigated the effects of pre-injury anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents on the transfusion amount and the need for massive transfusion in elderly patients with severe trauma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of elderly patients with severe trauma (age, ≥65 years; Injury Severity Score, ≥16) between September 2006 and March 2014. The selected patients were subsequently divided into patients who were: only taking warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel; taking various combinations of these agents; and a control group who were not taking any of these agents. RESULTS: During the study period, 67 patients (20%) were taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents and 272 patients were included in the control group. Among these patients, 10 were receiving only warfarin, 28 were receiving only aspirin, 14 were receiving only clopidogrel, and 13 were receiving various combinations of these medications. The amount of red cell concentrate and need for massive transfusions were only significantly increased in the warfarin group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the warfarin group had a significantly higher risk of needing a massive transfusion with multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 5.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-20.20; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients who were receiving only warfarin before their injury had an increased risk of bleeding due to non-head injuries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Pediatric guidelines recommend admission with follow-up laboratories, even for low-grade injuries. METHODS: Data sets from two large multicenter prospective observational studies were used to analyze a cohort of children (age, <17 years) with grade I to III SOI following blunt abdominal trauma. Children with hollow viscus injuries were excluded. Patients were divided into (a) those with or without other major injuries (OMIs) (traumatic brain injury, hemothorax or pneumothorax, pelvic fracture, urgent orthopedic or neurosurgical operations) and (b) with grade I or II versus grade III injuries. Outcomes included AIs (transfusion, angiography, abdominal operation) and disposition (admission unit and length of stay). RESULTS: There were 14,232 children enrolled in the two studies, and 791 patients had a SOI (5.6%). After excluding patients with hollow viscus injuries and higher-grade SOIs, 517 patients with a grade I to III SOI were included, and 262 of these had no OMI. Among patients with no OMI, none of 148 patients with grade I or II SOI underwent AI, while only 3 of 114 patients with grade III injuries underwent AI (3 transfusions/1 angioembolization). All three had hemoperitoneum; two of three had an additional organ with a grade II injury. Among grade I and II SOIs with no OMI, 28 (18.9%) of 148 were admitted to an intensive care unit, 110 (74.3%) of 148 to floor, and 7 (4.7%) of 148 discharged home from emergency department; median length of stay 2 days. Among grade III SOIs with no OMI, 38 (33.3%) of 114 were admitted to an intensive care unit and 61.4% to the floor; median length of stay was 4 days. Among 255 patients with a grade I to III SOI and other major organ system injuries, 31 (12.2%) underwent AI. CONCLUSION: No patient with a grade I and II SOI and no OMI following blunt abdominal trauma received intervention, suggesting that patients with low-grade SOI without OMIs could be safely observed and discharged from the emergency department.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) on pulmonary function following OPCAB. METHODS: Patients with LV ejection fraction ≤40% were randomly assigned to receive either a bolus of 100 mg/kg of intravenous NAC over a 15‐min period immediately after anesthetic induction, followed by an intravenous infusion at 40 mg/kg/day for 24 h (NAC group, n=24), or a placebo (control group, n=24). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters, and the incidence of acute lung injury (PaO(2)/FiO(2)<300 mmHg) were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) did not change during mechanical heart displacement compared with the baseline value in the NAC group while it was significantly increased in the control group. Significantly less number of patients developed acute lung injury at 2 h after the surgery in the NAC group. The other pulmonary parameters and the duration of ventilator care were all similar. CONCLUSIONS: NAC demonstrated promising results in terms of mitigating the increase in PVRI during mechanical heart displacement and attenuating the development of acute lung injury in the immediate post‐operative period. However, NAC could not induce a definite improvement in the other important pulmonary variables including PaO(2)/FiO(2) and Q(s)/Q(t), and did not lead to a decreased duration of ventilatory care or length of stay in the intensive care unit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study aimed to analyse the usage of the new workflow and improvements in outcomes. METHODS: We analysed the number of crossmatching and wrong-patient errors among the blood transfusion cases during 3 years of data collection (from August 2018 to July 2021). From May 2021 to July 2021, the new workflow was implemented. Outcomes were calculated according to the department type, patient age and processing time. The sample processing time was defined as the time from placing the order to lab arrival. RESULTS: The new workflow utilisation increased from 50.7% to 80.3% and wrong-patient errors decreased annually. The new workflow was used for more adults (3001/3680 samples, 81.5%) than paediatric cases (345/522 samples, 65.5%; p < 0.001) and in general wards than in the emergency room or intensive care unit.

CONCLUSION: Wrong-patient errors were reduced without increasing sample-processing time after introducing the new workflow which included using an electronic identification system. The time needed for the blood processing differed according to the ward type, patient age, and timing of the request.

METHODS: Between October 2013 and December 2019, 144 patients who did not undergo tricuspid valve repair (TVR) during LVAD implantation in our department were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the TI grade; Group 1: 106 patients (73.6%) with moderate TI and Group 2: 38 patients (26.4%) with severe TI. All patients were evaluated for mortality, need of inotrope, blood product transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and early and late right ventricular failure (RVF). Minimally invasive technique was favored in patients with worse right ventricular (RV) function to prevent the need for postoperative RV support and bleeding. RESULTS: The mean ages of the patients in the Group 1 and Group 2 were 46 ± 15 years (82% male), and 45 ± 11.2 years (81.5% males), respectively.

METHODS: Tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were studied in 32 patients 1, 2, 3 and 7 days after craniocerebral injury. Repeated cranial CT scans and platelet counts were made simultaneously. Same measurements were done in 30 normal adults except CT scan. RESULTS: No obvious difference was found in age, sex and platelet count between the injured and the normal groups. TFPI/TF decreased markedly in the first week after injury in patients with SBI, but only decreased on the 7th day in the patients without obvious SBI. For the patients who developed delayed intracranial hematoma (DIH) or hematoma enlargement, TF rose only 1 and 2 days after injury, but TFPI had a tendency to rise again after a fall on the 3rd day. For those patients who developed no DIH, TF rose all the time within the 1st week. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of TFPI/TF for a long time, especially within 3 days after injury, may be one of the most important reasons for SBI. High expression of TF for a relative short time and increase of TFPI after a fall within 3 days may be one of the important reasons for DIH or hematoma enlargement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Neverthless, RBC transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Restrictive strategy policy, based on a haemoglobin [Hb] level of 7 g dL, is the guideline to transfuse most of ICU patients. The aim of RBC transfusion is to avoid tissue hypoxia by improving oxygen delivery (DO2) and therefore oxygen consumption (VO2). This could suggest to combine [Hb] and some parameters reflecting the sytemic DO2 VO2 balance to decide to transfuse. This study aims to analyse the effects of RBC transfusion on the systemic oxygenation assessed by the (central) venous oxygen saturation (S(c) VO2), the lactate level, the venous-to-arterial carbon dioxyde pressure gradient (Pv-aCO2) and the ratio between cardiac index and O2 extraction (IC EO2), and to assess their usefulness in the transfusion decision. Patients and methods: During 9 months, all adult patients transfused in the ICU of CHU-Charleroi Marie Curie were included except patients with active bleeding or without jugular or subclavicular catheter. The systemic oxygenation parameters have been measured before and after transfusion. Patients a priori have been grouped according to their initial S(c)VO2 (< or > 70%), to their cardiac (< or > 50% of a left ventricular ejection fraction) and septic status. The results are expressed in median and interquartile ranges. Comparisons were made by a Wilcoxon test. Results: 86 RBC transfusions were made on 53 patients. For all patients, mean arterial pressure, [Hb] and S(c)VO2 increased significantly after transfusion ([Hb]: 7.4 [7-7.8] to 8.3 [7.7-8.8] g dL; MAP: 79 [69-90] to 82 [74-92] mmHg and S(c)VO2: 66 [60-73] to 69 [63-75] %; for all p < 0.001). Only patients with an initial S(c)VO2 < 70% improved it after transfusion (62 [58-65] to 66 [62-71] %; p < 0.001). The Pv-aCO2 was significantly higher in patients with an initial S(c)VO2 < 70% (8 [5-10] mmHg) but did not change after transfusion as [lactate] and IC EO2. These results are maintained whatever the cardiac or septic status. Conclusion: A S(c)VO2 < 70% in anemic ICU patients compared to other systemic oxygenation parameters, seems to be useful to assess the transfusion requirement as indicator of a DO2 VO2 imbalance. It should be interesting to combine it with the [Hb] in the decision to transfuse anemic critically ill patient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Shodai""=>[""これは前後調査ではありませんでしょうか？""]}",,"",,

Ustrzycka 11, 02-141",,Background: Ruptured liver after transplant is a rare complication. It can lead to graft or patient loss. Few reports are available in literature. Case Report: A 58 y old male patient underwent a deceased donor liver transplant due to hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis. The donor was a 38 y old trauma victim. There were no obvious injuries involving the liver during organ recovery but multiple petechiae appeared on the surface of the right lobe after preservative solution infusion. The transplant procedure was uneventful. The patient recovered quickly. On the second day the patient developed severe hypotension and laparotomy showed a deep laceration in the right lobe separating the anterior and posterior sectors. Massive blood transfusion was needed. Homeostasis was extremely difficult and partial right lobe resection needed to control bleeding. The patient recovered and was discharged two weeks after the transplant. Conclusions: Hematomas secondary to interventional procedures may be treated conservatively but spontaneous hematomas mostly will need surgery. The presence of petechiae on the surface of the graft may indicate a high energy injury and the possibility of intrahepatic hematoma that may rupture after implantation. © Ann Transplant.,"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Primary Aim: To assess IR, patients will undergo EHC on study day 2 and 7 or day of discharge from ICU. Secondary Aims: Near continuous data capture of glycemic control via CPOE system will be assessed for surrogate measures of IR. Other laboratory endpoints that may serve as biomarkers of the stress response will be collected daily to day 7. Patients will be followed for mortality and infectious morbidity for 28 days or until hospital discharge. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: To ensure that the injured patient cohort identified for entry is at sufficient risk for the development of organ dysfunction, infectious complications, and death, while surviving in the ICU for 5 days or longer, the investigators analyzed patient visits to VUMC to identify entry criteria that provided roughly 20% mortality with appropriate length of stay. Enrollment criteria include: ‐ Severe trauma (ISS > 16) ‐ Mechanical ventilation ‐ Either blood transfusion or inotropic support prior to enrollment. ‐ No prior history of diabetes Enrollment Goals: A total of 24 subjects in this trial at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Subject identification: All mechanically ventilated, adult patients admitted directly to the Trauma ICU will be screened for appropriate ISS, transfusion need, and inotropic support within the first 24 hrs of admission. Informed consent and subject enrollment: If the patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) will be approached for consent for trial participation. Randomization of study subjects: Patients will be randomized in blocks to receive either placebo or IV glutamine dipeptide (1:1) using a computerized randomization algorithm. Solutions will be prepared by an unblinded pharmacist and placed in identical infusion bags; study and placebo solutions will have identical appearance and smell. Study Measurements: Surrogate measures of IR will include: mean serum glucose, insulin requirement on standard glycemic control protocol, serum insulin, C‐peptide, adiponectin, glutamine and isoprostane levels each standardized to individual patient nutritional provision throughout the ICU stay. Biomarkers of the physiologic stress response and their recovery include TNF, IL‐6, IL‐8 and estradiol. Clinical Data from Medical Record: Clinical data will be obtained during the course of standard care. All data is maintained in an electronic medical record and electronic data repository. Discrete data points will be validated at the point of entry and captured prospectively. Clinical Endpoints: Patients will be followed for 28 days or until hospital discharge to assess for patient survival and for infectious complications. Infections will be defined using CDC definitions. For ventilated patients, quantitative bronchoscopic alveolar lavage will be performed except where contraindicated. Patients will be assessed daily until discharge and at day 28 for infections and survival. Daily SOFA scores will be captured from admission until day 7 or discharge from the ICU. Safety: This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board and will adhere to the regulations for the protection of human subjects. GlnD has been approved in Europe for intravenous use and has been extensively studied in critically ill populations. All other measurements, other than the EHC are obtained through processes that are standard of care. Blood samples obtained daily will be less than 10 mL and will not pose more than minimal risk. Glycemic management is provided as a standard of care and has been documented to be safe and effective at the investigators institution with blood glucoses obtained every 2 hours. During the euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp, blood glucose is controlled by altering glucose provision rather than insulin rate. This allows more rapid and precise adjustments. Measurements are obtained much more frequently than during standard processes. These methods have previously been validated for safety in the literature and patients are intensively monitored during the test.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Minimal data exist on rBVM use to prevent hypotension in dialysis of critically ill children for acute renal failure. Purpose of the Study: To assess the efficacy of rBVM to decrease hypotension episodes in critically ill children. Methods: All children admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Sainte-Justine hospital from 2000 to 2007, between 1 and 18 years old, and who received intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) for acute renal failure were included. Demographic data and IHD treatments characteristics were recorded including: (i) use of rBVM, (ii) red blood cell transfusion (RBCT), (iii) hypotension episodes, (iv) intervention during IHD (i.e., ultrafiltration [UF] reduced, UF stopped, saline bolus, and dialysis terminated early). Intermittent hemodialysis treatments were divided into 3 groups: group A, IHD without rBVM; group B, IHD with rBVM and no RBCT; and group C, IHD with rBVM and RBCT. The number of treatments with intradialytic hypotension and hypotension-free IHD treatments were compared between group A and group B using chi-square test. Results: Twenty-five patients with a median age of 14 years old (1.8-18 years) and 44 kg body weight (10-85 kg) were included. The median pediatric index of mortality (PIM2) at admission in PICU was 12.5% (0.1%-92%) and organ dysfunction score at hemodialysis start (PELOD score) was 12 (0-33). Survivors at PICU discharge were 17/25 (68%). Twenty-five patients had 146 IHD treatments: 64 in group A, 70 in group B, and 12 in group C. Hypotension episodes were similar between group A and group B (35.9% vs. 95% CI [23.9%; 48.0%] and 32.9% vs. 95% CI [21.6%; 44.1%], respectively), but median UF was higher in group B (30.2 and 40.4 mL/kg/treatment, respectively). There was a significant increase of interventions in hypotension-free IHD treatments between group A and group B (P<0.01): 9.4% vs. 95% CI [2.0%; 16.7%] and 34.3% vs. 95% CI [22.9%; 45.7%], respectively. This increase was associated with a higher median UF (33.2 and 45.6 mL/kg/treatment, respectively). Conclusions: Hypotension episodes were observed in one-third of IHD treatments, in critically ill children. In the absence of validated rBVM threshold to trigger intervention for critically ill children, use of rBVM was associated with higher UF and similar hypotension episodes. Specific guidelines on rBVM use may decrease hypotension episodes in critically ill children during IHD treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Case Summaries: Both patients were initially dosed 10 mg of alteplase followed by infusion of 90 mg over 2 hours, but remained in obstructive shock requiring significant inotropic and vasopressor support. Both patients were deemed poor candidates for embolectomy. The first patient received repeated doses reaching an accumulative dose of 200 mg alteplase over 15 hours. The second patient received an accumulative dose of 250 mg alteplase over 36 hours. Both patients had resolution of shock within 24 hours of repeated administration of alteplase, but also experienced significant drops in hemoglobin, which were supported with transfusions. They were transferred out of the intensive care unit after resolution of obstructive shock and hemorrhage. The first patient died one week after transfer from the intensive care unit due to invasive candidiasis and septic shock. The second patient was weaned from the ventilator and discharged home. Conclusion: Patients with obstructive shock secondary to massive pulmonary embolism despite a one-time dose of alteplase and poor candidacy for embolectomy may benefit from repeated doses of alteplase. Due to the short half-life, repeated administration of thrombolytic may be appropriate for younger patients without absolute contraindications to thrombolysis, but future studies are needed to identify the optimal patient population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

To our knowledge, this is the first case to result in the simultaneous combination of massive hemorrhage, inadvertent cystotomy, bladder necrosis, vaginal cuff necrosis, and vesicovaginal fistula formation. Case Description: A 30-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for 3 prior cesarean sections, found to have placental invasion of the bladder (detected by ultrasound and confirmed by MRI), presented at 33 weeks with premature labor. After a cesarian section, the subsequent hysterectomy was complicated by severe hemorrhage. During removal of adherent placental tissues, a 10 cm inadvertent cystotomy at the bladder dome was created. After her bladder was repaired, she underwent bilateral internal iliac artery embolization. On post-operative day #41, an exploratory laparotomy revealed complete dehiscence of the cystotomy repair with a walled-off urinoma in communication with a necrotic vaginal cuff, forming a large vesicovaginal fistula. The vaginal cuff was debrided and closed horizontally. The bladder was closed vertically (to avoid overlapping suture lines with the vagina) and leak tested. A flap of omentum was interposed between vagina and bladder. The patient recovered well, was discharged home 2 days after surgery; she reported feeling like herself again, without urinary complaints at 3 months after the surgery. Conclusions: This case report highlights the clinical course of a patient with placental invasion into the urinary bladder and the associated urologic complications. Urologists should be aware of this condition as the urinary bladder is the most commonly invaded extrauterine location.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

This study aimed to assess the incidence of posttrauma complications, their relationship with poor outcomes, and the effect of the Injury Severity Score (ISS) on their occurrence. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a pair of trauma centers, between January 2020 and December 2022. All hospitalized adult patients with multiple trauma were included in this study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to posttrauma complications. Results Among 727 multiple trauma patients, 90 (12.4%) developed in-hospital complications. The most frequent complications were pneumonia (4.8%), atelectasis (3.7%), and superficial surgical site infection (2.5%). According to multivariable logistic regression, ISS, the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the length of stay in the hospital, and mortality were significantly associated with complications. The complication rate increased by 17% with every single-unit increase in ISS (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.38). Per every 1-day increase in the ICU or hospital stay, the complication rate increased by 65% (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.00–2.73) and 20% (adjusted OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03–1.41), respectively. Posttrauma complications were also significantly more common in patients with mortality (adjusted OR, 163.30; 95% CI, 3.04–8,779.32). In multiple trauma patients with a higher ISS, the frequency, severity, and number of complications were significantly increased. Conclusion In-hospital complications in multiple trauma patients are frequent and associated with poor outcomes and mortality. ISS is an important factor associated with posttrauma complications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Septic shock is taken as a subset of sepsis in which there is intense circulatory and metabolic abnormalities. it is associated with higher risk of morbidity and mortality as compared to sepsis alone. Sepsis can also lead to dysfunction in multiple organs of the body leading to the so-called MODS. Platelet indices are routinely used blood tests however their application as prognostic markers in sepsis hasn’t been utilised fully. We intend to do the needful for it. Objectives: Assess platelet indices like MPV, PDW, Platecrit as interpreters of in hospital mortality in Sepsis, to evaluate the effect of different platelet indices as prognostic markers of sepsis, to assess severity of sepsis by assessment of immature platelet function in bacterial infection. Methods: The study is a prospective cross-sectional study, All the consecutive/sequential patients > 18 years of age, admitted to Medicine ICU in tertiary medical hospital. The severity for the sepsis is graded using the APACHE II scoring and diagnosis is done using the bedside q SOFA test. Results: From the following study we will be able to correlate that platelet indices are useful to predict the prognosis in sepsis patients. Conclusion: using the above study we can correlate platelet indices to in hospital mortality and severity of the disease. Patients with severe disease are thought to have reduced platelet count and other changes in platelet indices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: Retrospective study including all patients with SCID receiving first AD transplantation using PTCY in three pediatric centers. Statistics were performed using the EZR program. Results: Thirty-seven SCID patients were transplanted between January 2012 and September 2021 at a median age of 9.8 months (range 1.9-109). Seventy percent were male, 67% were malnourished. All but 5 were vaccinated with BCG and 59% had BCGitis/osis before transplant. 40% had a first-grade relative dying from infection at an early age, 64% had comorbidities and/or active infections at admission. Bone marrow was the stem cell source in 98% and the father was the donor in 75%. A total of 35 had haploidentical donors, one had a matched unrelated and one a mismatched related donor (9/10). Most regimens were Busulfan-based (81%), 7 patients received low-dose TBI-based conditioning, and the median total nucleated cell infused was 7.1 × 107/kg. Since most patients were already infected or had severe comorbidities during transplant, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis were frequent (in 35%, 27%, and 19%, respectively). Severe and very severe hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was observed in almost a third of the cases (27%), all in the busulfan group. The 28- and 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil and platelet recovery was 81% and 75%, respectively. At 100 days, CI of acute GVHD grades II-IV was 21.6% and, at 2 years, CI of chronic GVHD was 12.4%. The CI of CMV reactivation was 40% at a median of 25 days after transplant. BCG infection reactivation occurred in 34% of the vaccinated patients. The median length of inpatient stay was 58 days (range 21-245). With a median follow-up of 31 months, 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74.6% and, although not statistically significant, there was a trend to an inferior OS when comparing patients with or without comorbidities (65.2% vs. 92.3% p=0.09). Nine patients died at a median of 22 days after HCT (range 8-308), with 6 very-early deaths (five due to severe infection, and one due to SOS). There were no graft failures, but mixed chimerism was frequent (34%) and led to an inability to stay off IGIV after transplant in 21% of patients. The median CD4+ count at 100 days was 144 (range 4-741) and did not impact survival. Conclusions: This is one of the largest series of SCID patients receiving AD Transplantation using PTCY and, although most of our patients were referred at an older age, with severe infections and multiple comorbidities, OS was good. SCID patients should be referred to specialized centers as these transplants are very challenging and need an experienced multidisciplinary team. Newborn screening programs may allow these children to be diagnosed with better clinical conditions and have even better outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

However, patients with cancer usually present hypercoagulable state. Thus, we sought to evaluate the effect of uremia on platelet function in cancer patients. Methods: We prospectively analysed patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a Cancer University Hospital with sepsis. Renal dysfunction was classified according to the AKIN criteria. Impact‐R was used to evaluate platelet function under near physiological flow conditions using cone and plate technology. In this test, an image analyser quantifies the adhered platelets and results are expressed as percentage of well surface covered by aggregates (SC %) as an index of adhesion and average size of the aggregates (AS microm2) as an index of aggregation. Results: A total of 144 patients were enrolled in this study. AKI developed in 98 patients (AKIN 1 ‐ 34, AKIN 2 ‐ 25, AKIN 3 ‐ 39) compared to 46 cancer patients without AKI; mean age 61±13y ; 57% male; 86% solid tumors, 14% hematological tumors. The evaluation of platelet function by Impact‐R® showed that platelet adhesion was higher in the severe AKI group. Conclusions: Severe renal dysfunction (AKIN 3) increases platelet adhesion in cancer patients. (Table Presented).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Traditional laboratory tests do not adequately characterize coagulation derangements in patients with bleeding. We sought to establish preoperative thromboelastography parameters in children prior to cardiopulmonary bypass, to compare thromboelastography assessment with standard coagulation parameters postoperatively, and to assess thromboelastography in children with significant hemorrhage. Methods: Sixty patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in a prospective observational study of perioperative thromboelastography. Thromboelastography measures were obtained preoperatively, intraoperatively after protamine administration, upon admit to the intensive care unit, and when patients were treated for bleeding. Thromboelastography measures were not used for clinical care. Postoperative thromboelastography measurements were compared with the standard coagulation parameters. Intraoperative thromboelastography, postoperative thromboelastography, and clinical outcomes were compared among patients who did and did not have significant postoperative bleeding. Results: Preoperative thromboelastography parameters were similar to other published normal values for pediatric patients. Transfusion recommendations based on thromboelastography measurements were significantly different from those based on the standard coagulation testing. Thromboelastography measures after initial protamine administration were significantly different in patients with postoperative bleeding. This difference was not present upon arrival to the intensive care unit. Patients with significant bleeding tended to cease bleeding when clinical interventions were in agreement with recommendations based on thromboelastography. Conclusions: Pediatric patients with significant postoperative bleeding after surgery are more likely to have abnormal thromboelastography early after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Thromboelastography illustrates derangements in the coagulation system and may aid in the treatment of postoperative bleeding. © The Author(s) 2012.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Sixty-one patients were analysed both as a group and as two subgroups - those with incomplete abortions and those with other pregnancy-related diagnoses. Results. Derangements in platelet counts, serum creatinine levels and prothrombin international normalised ratio (INR) were present in all patients on the day of admission to hospital. In the group with incomplete abortions absolute levels of these parameters may be used to identify those patients with a worse outcome. The mortality rate was 38%. Conclusion. Early ICU admission and aggressive surgical intervention are strongly recommended in patients with septic incomplete abortions presenting with more than a single organ dysfunction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients in intensive care unit (ICU) are probably more at risk for TACO, as they are more frequently transfused and present more comorbidities. But epidemiology of TACO in ICU is not well known, leading to a high risk of underdiagnosis. We conducted a scoping review to describe TACO in pediatric and adult ICUs. Methods: Systematic search of databases was completed in May 2018. Studies were eligible if they reported at least either the incidence, risk factors, or outcomes of TACO in adult and/or pediatric ICU patients. Observational or interventional, retrospective or prospective published studies, with >10 patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened and identified the studies. Data were then extracted using a standardized report form. Pooled incidence was calculated with a random-effect model in case of high heterogeneity (I2>50%) and a fixed-effect model else. Results: Among 5926 studies identified, nine met the inclusion criteria and were included. Five studies were prospective, four were retrospective including one retrospective study with a prospective screening for TACO. The pooled incidence of TACO was 5.5% (95% C.I. 2.6 - 9.4%) in adult ICU (4 studies, 2252 patients, high heterogeneity) and 0% (95% C.I. 0.0-1.1%) in pediatric ICU (2 studies, 345 patients, low heterogeneity). A third pediatric study (136 patients) reported variable incidences between 1.5 and 76%, depending on diagnostic criteria. Risk factors for TACO (4 adult studies) included positive fluid balance, number and type of products transfused, the rate of transfusion, and pre-existing cardiovascular and renal comorbidities. TACO was associated with increased ICU and hospital length of stay, while the association with mortality was not consistent. Conclusions: TACO is frequent in ICU patients and is associated with adverse outcome. TACO seems to be underrecognized in pediatric ICU probably due to the lack of an operational definition adjusted for this population. Further researches are warranted to improve the knowledge of pediatric TACO and the safety of transfusion in ICU patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

A prospective follow-up study was done to evaluate the short-term and mid-term outcomes of type II diabetic patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting at our institution between 1996 and May 1999. A total of 200 patients, 100 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (group I) and 100 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (group II), met the inclusion criteria of the study and were included in the clinical follow-up study. Results. The characteristics of the patients of the two groups were similar for baseline clinical angiographic and operative characteristics. In particular, no significant differences in cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping times were noted between the two groups. The number grafts per patient was similar between the two groups. There were no in-hospital deaths, but postoperative complications were different among the two series. In fact, 33% of patients in group I had at least one major complication compared with 20% in group II (p = 0.037). The cumulative number of complications was 148 in group I and 69 in group II, and the mean number of complications per patient was 4.5 and 3.5 in groups I and II, respectively. The major differences in perioperative complication rates were found in the need for prolonged (> 24 hours) ventilation, occurrence of respiratory or renal insufficiency, and mediastinitis. The mean length of stay in the intensive care unit and for total hospitalization were longer in group I than group II (4.3 ± 2.8 days versus 2.8 ± 2.7 days [p = 0.010] and 11.1 ± 2.2 days versus 7.2 ± 2.4 group II [p < 0.05], respectively). At long-term follow-up, group I patients had a significantly higher mortality rate (29% versus 10%, p < 0.001). Moreover, overall late cardiac and noncardiac complication rates were significantly higher in group I than II (37% versus 22%, p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis including several preoperative and operative variables, treatment by insulin, advanced age (> 75 years), left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%), and complex lesions at coronary angiography (American Heart Association lesion classification type C lesion) were found as independent predictors of increased mortality. Conclusions. Our data show that patients with insulin-dependent type II diabetes who had coronary artery bypass grafting have a significantly higher rate of major postoperative complications with an extremely unfavorable short- and long-term prognosis. Diabetic patients on insulin treatment should be considered high-risk candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting and require intense perioperative and long-term monitoring. Further studies will be necessary to investigate whether such conclusions may be appropriate for newer surgical strategies such as off-pump operation. © 2003 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Patients who experience delirium are at higher risk of other adverse outcomes. Identification of patients at risk will allow us to target preventive strategies and improve informed consent. The purpose of this study was to compare two novel Machine Learning (ML) data analysis approach, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian Networks (BN), against standard Logistic Regression modeling (LogR) in predicting delirium among cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: The Maritime Heart Center (MHC) registry is a comprehensive database covering all cardiac surgery patients. We examined data of patients who underwent CABG and or valve surgery between 2006 and 2012. Delirium was defined as a temporary mental disturbance requiring medical or physical intervention. Dataset were split randomly into Derivation (80%) and validation (20%) subsets. In this analysis, we used two ML statistical tools: ANN, which is a non-linear technique that models complex relationships, and BN, which is a type of graphical models that provide a natural tool for dealing with uncertainty and complexity. These results were compared with a conventional stepwise LogR. RESULTS: Among the 5,584 patients who met the study criteria, 634 (11.4%) experienced delirium. Interestingly, both approaches produced similar predictive variables for delirium (e.g., age, CVD & blood transfusion), although the variable weighting was different. Using the validation set, specificity was excellent across all models (95.8% for ANN, 93.3% for BN and 97.7% for LogR). However, the positive predictive value was 46.1% for ANN, 41.5% for BN and 33.3% for LogR. Sensitivity was 27.5% for ANN, 37% for BN and only 8.6% for LogR. Receiver operator curves were 76.6% for ANN, 76.4% for BN and 77.2% for LogR. CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully demonstrate the use of statistical machine learning Methods (namely: ANN and BN) in the prediction of delirium. ML Methods generated superior results compared to standard LogR. ML techniques offer novel and alternative approaches to aid in the prediction of complex relationships, which is a typical feature of adverse medical events.

This study assessed whether a bundle of care including pre-operative and post-operative administration of erythropoietin (EPO) with intravenous iron supplementation, and restrictive transfusion adjusted for ScvO(2) could result in reduced postoperative transfusions. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group controlled pilot study, patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with high risk of transfusion in a University Hospital were enrolled by the investigator and the randomisation procedure using a central internet-based system was made by the clinical research assistant. Since the trial was open-label, no masking was used. Patients were assigned (1:1) to either the STOP group (40,000 IU subcutaneous EPO combined with 20 mg/kg intravenous ferric carboxymaltose if Hb < 13 g/dL the day before surgery or at ICU admission, and RBC transfusion if Hb ≤ 8 g/dL and ScvO(2) ≤ 65%, or additional EPO dose if 8 < Hb < 13 g/dL) or to the control group (RBC transfusion if Hb ≤ 8 g/dL, or, if 8 < Hb < 13 g/dL, intravenous iron sucrose 200 mg or 300 mg according to weight). Primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative RBC transfusion up to hospital discharge or postoperative day 28. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04141631. FINDINGS: Between Jan 20, 2020, and Sept 6, 2022, among 128 patients enrolled, 123 (male, 54.4%, 67/123) were included in the full analysis set: 62 in the STOP group and 61 in the control group. Nine patients (14.5%, 9/62) in the STOP group required RBC transfusion vs 19 (31.2%, 19/61) in the control group (odds ratio 0.37 [95% CI: 0.15-0.91], p = 0.03). The median length of follow up to transfusion was 2.6 days (1.5; 4.6) and 3.3 (1.6; 4.2) in control and STOP groups respectively (p = 0.61). INTERPRETATION: The bundle of care may reduce postoperative RBC transfusion. The findings should be taken with caution due to the unblinded and exploratory nature of the study.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether FFP and PC storage duration is associated with increased in hospital mortality risk across cardiac surgery, acute medicine, ICU and orthopaedic surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-stage individual patient data meta-analyses were performed to determine the effects of FFP and PC storage duration on in hospital mortality. Preset random effects models were used to determine pooled unadjusted and adjusted (adjusted for age, gender and units of product transfused) effect estimates. RESULTS: The FFP storage duration analysis included 3625 patients across four studies. No significant association was observed between duration of storage and in hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis, but after adjusting for patient age, gender and units of product a small increased risk of in hospital mortality was observed for each additional month of storage (OR: 1·05, 95% CI: 1·01-1·08). This effect was no longer statistically significant when donor ABO blood group was incorporated into the random effects model on post hoc analyses. A total of 547 patients across five studies were incorporated in the PC storage duration analysis. No association was observed between PC storage duration and odds of in hospital morality (adjusted OR: 0·94, 95% CI: 0·79-1·11). CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support shortening FFP or PC shelf life based on in hospital mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Although myocarditis not reported as a common complication we present a case series of dengue fever with cardiac involvement observed during a period of month August to December 2021 at PBM & Associated Group of Hospital, Bikaner Rajasthan. Case presentation: We have been reported 9 cases of dengue complicated with cardiac involvement admitted to Wards and ICU at PBM & Associated Group of Hospital. Age group ranging from 15 to 65 years. In our case series out of 9 cases comparising 2 females and 7 males. The group had 5 cases of Dengue hemorrhagic fever with dengue shock syndrome, 2 cases had Dengue hemorrhagic fever, 2 cases had dengue shock syndrome. There is co-infection of dengue with malaria in 2 cases. All cases had acute dengue hepatitis. Blood transfusion and other empirical therapeutic methods used apart from meticulous fluid management to suit issue of each patient. Bed side USG, digital chest x-ray PA view & 2D ECHO scanning help in early detection of critical phase of dengue. Out of 9 cases with complicated dengue 7 patients recovered and 2 patients expired. Data were collected during hospital admission, stay and follow up visits. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on patients with age group more than 15 years and having confirmed dengue fever. Patient on medication affecting heart Rate, Rhythms, pre-existing heart disease and electrolytes abnormalities excluded. A base line ECG, Troponin I NT Pro BNP were done for all patients. The biomarkers were measured using Enzyme linked immune fluorescent assay and recommended cut off were used. Patients with increased biomarkers gone for 2D ECHO (As per criteria of European society of cardiology 2019). Conclusion: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in dengue may be overlooked due to Nonspecific clinical finding and co-existing multi organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to micro-geographical variation and unusual out break of dengue. Co-infection of malaria should be considered in managing patients especially in endemic area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: We compared hemodynamic parameters obtained before and after RBC transfusion (2 RBC units) in 34 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. RESULTS: Directly after RBC transfusion, we observed a significant increase in hematocrit (28 ± 3 vs. 22 ± 2%, p < 0.001), hemoglobin (9.4 ± 0.9 vs. 7.6 ± 0.8 g/dL, p < 0.001), arterial oxygen content (CaO₂) (12.2 ± 1.2 vs. 9.9 ± 1.0 mL/dL, p < 0.001), and oxygen delivery (DO₂) (1073 ± 369 vs. 934 ± 288 mL/min, p < 0.001) compared with baseline. Cardiac output (CO) (8.89 ± 3.06 vs. 9.42 ± 2.75 L/min, p = 0.020), cardiac index (CI) (4.53 ± 1.36 vs. 4.82 ± 1.21 L/min/m², p = 0.016), and heart rate (91 ± 16 vs. 95 ± 14 bpm, p = 0.007) were significantly lower following RBC transfusion while no significant change in stroke volume (SV) was observed. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) (median 87 vs. 78 mmHg, p < 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (median 1212 vs. 1103 dyn*s*cm⁻⁵*m², p = 0.001) significantly increased directly after RBC transfusion. Global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients, the transfusion of 2 RBC units induces a significant decrease in CO and CI because of a significant decrease in heart rate (while SV remains unchanged). Despite the decrease in CO, DO₂ significantly increases because of a significant increase in CaO₂. In addition, RBC transfusion results in a significant increase in MAP and SVRI. No significant changes in TPTD-parameters reflecting cardiac preload (GEDVI), pulmonary edema (EVLWI), and pulmonary vascular permeability (PVPI) are observed following RBC transfusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

ICU setting is multifactorial, but newer anticoagulation agents are the potentially contributing causes. Critically ill patients may suffer from disorders because of surgery or trauma, in addition to acquired causes including antiplatelet agents and the new oral anticoagulants. An understanding of the coagulopathy, hemostatic considerations, and therapeutic approaches is important when managing these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: All anticoagulation agents may contribute to coagulopathy in critically ill patients. Options for management include hemodialysis, transfusion of blood products, and prohemostatic drugs. Recombinant and purified coagulation therapies are also now available in most countries that provide clinicians with specific agents to treat targeted deficiencies. SUMMARY: Coagulopathy occurs in ICU patients because of multiple factors including anticoagulants, dilution, fibrinolysis, and factor consumption. Therapeutic prohemostatic pharmacologic approaches, in addition to standard transfusion therapy, need to be considered in managing coagulopathy in the ICU setting.

A score was devised, incorporating objective parameters that would reflect the likelihood to influence patient outcome. The purpose was to create a new method for evaluating the quality of care the perfusionist provides during CPB procedures and to deduce whether it predicts patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We analysed 295 consecutive elective patients. We chose 10 parameters: fluid balance, blood transfused, Hct, ACT, PaO2, PaCO2, pH, BE, potassium and CPB time. Distribution analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilcoxon test. This made up the PerfSCORE and we tried to find a correlation to mortality rate, patient stay in the ICU and length of mechanical ventilation. Univariate analysis (UA) using linear regression was established for each parameter. Statistical significance was established when p < 0.05. Multivariate analysis (MA) was performed with the same parameters. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.8 +/- 12.6 years with 70% males. There were 180 CABG, 88 valves, and 27 combined CABG/valve procedures. The PerfSCORE of 6.6 +/- 2.4 (0-20), mortality of 2.7% (8/295), CPB time 100 +/- 41 min (19-313), ICU stay 52 +/- 62 hrs (7-564) and mechanical ventilation of 10.5 +/- 14.8 hrs (0-564) was calculated. CPB time, fluid balance, PaO2, PerfSCORE and blood transfused were significantly correlated to mortality (UA, p < 0.05). Also, CPB time, blood transfused and PaO2 were parameters predicting mortality (MA, p < 0.01). Only pH was significantly correlated for predicting ICU stay (UA). Ultrafiltration (UF) and CPB time were significantly correlated (UA, p < 0.01) while UF (p < 0.05) was the only parameter predicting mechanical ventilation duration (MA). CONCLUSIONS: CPB time, blood transfused and PaO2 are independent risk factors of mortality. Fluid balance, blood transfusion, PaO2, PerfSCORE and CPB time are independent parameters for predicting morbidity. PerfSCORE is a quality of perfusion measure that objectively quantifies perfusion performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

About 30-75% of patients with type 2 of HIT develop thrombosis as a result of platelet activation. The most important clinical symptom is thrombocytopenia. Patients with severe COVID-19 are among those receiving heparinoids. This meta-analysis performed to picture the current knowledge and results of published studies in this field. Three search engines were searched and 575 papers were found. After evaluation, 37 articles were finally selected of which 13 studies were quantitatively analyzed. The pooled frequency rate of suspected cases with HIT in 13 studies with 11,241 patients was 1.7%. The frequency of HIT was 8.2% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation subgroup with 268 patients and 0.8% in the hospitalization subgroup with 10,887 patients. The coincidence of these two conditions may increase the risk of thrombosis. Of the 37 patients with COVID-19 and confirmed HIT, 30 patients (81%) were treated in the intensive care unit or had severe COVID-19. The most commonly used anticoagulants were UFH in 22 cases (59.4%). The median platelet count before treatment was 237 (176-290) x 10(3)/µl and the median nadir platelet count was 52 (31-90.5) x 10(3)/µl.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate possible risk factors influencing prolonged ICU stay in a large referral hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to determinate causes of prolonged ICU stay in 280 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery in a tertiary care center for cardiovascular patients, Tehran, Iran. These patients were divided into two groups according to ICU stay ≤ 96 and > 96 hours. We evaluated perioperative risk factors of ICU stay > 96 hours. RESULTS: Among the 280 patients studied, 184 (65.7%) had stayed ≤ 96 hours and 96 (34.3%) had stayed > 96 hours in ICU. Frequency of prolonged ICU stay was 34.2% in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), 30.8% in patients with valve surgery, and 44.8% in patients with CABG plus valve surgery. Patients with > 96 hours of ICU stay received more blood transfusion and intravenous inotropes. They also had longer anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass, and postoperative intubation time. There were higher incidence of postoperative tamponade, re-exploration, re-intubation, hemodialysis, and hypotension in this group (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, about one-third of patients had prolonged ICU stay. Factors influencing prolonged ICU stay were medical and some non-medical factors. In the present study, up to 30% of the patients had a prolonged ICU stay of > 96 hours. Additional data from well-designed investigations are needed for further assessment of the factors influencing prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Saunders,,"BACKGROUND: Several severity scoring systems for critically ill patients have become increasingly popular over the past two decades. The APACHE III Score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) is a unique score that uses daily updates of clinical information to calculate a dynamic predicted mortality score. No studies exist to date that compare APACHE III to predict outcomes in patients presenting to the ICU with upper versus lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. AIM: To investigate the prognostic accuracy of the APACHE III scoring system in predicting multiple outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU with upper and lower GI bleeding. METHODS: 357 admissions to our ICU with acute GI bleeding over a 30 month time period were studied. A total of 262 upper GI bleeds, 71 lower GI bleeds, and 24 occult/obscure GI bleeds were identified. All subjects were assigned an APACHE III Score on the day of admission to the ICU. Data was then collected on the following outcomes for each subject: length of ICU stay, total length of hospital stay, endoscopic procedures, endoscopic findings and therapy, surgery, total blood transfusion requirements, rate of rebleeding, rate of readmission within 30 days, 30 day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and cost. RESULTS: Comparison between upper and lower GI bleeding showed a significantly higher mean APACHE III Score for upper GI bleeds compared to lower GI bleeds (p=0.035). After adjusting for age and sex, regression analysis showed the APACHE III score significantly predicted length of ICU stay (p=0.01), mean number of PRBCs transfused (UGIB p<0.0001, LGIB p=0.012), and cost (p<0.004) for both upper and lower GI bleeds. APACHE III was able to predict 30 day mortality and in-hospital mortality (p<0.0001) for upper GI bleeds but not lower GI bleeds. The lack of predictive capability for mortality of lower GI bleeds (30 day p=0.190, in-hospital p=0.702) may be due to the overall low mortality rate in these patients (2.82%). For upper GI bleeds alone, APACHE III also predicted number of endoscopic procedures and need for interventional radiology therapy (p=0.016). APACHE III did not predict rate of rebleeding for either upper or lower GI bleeds. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Upper GI bleeds have a higher APACHE III Score and higher mortality compared to lower GI bleeds admitted to an ICU. 2) The APACHE III Scoring system is more applicable in patients with upper GI bleeding compared with lower GI bleeding with the ability to accurately predict 30 day mortality and in-hospital mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, comorbid conditions, aortic pathology, surgical procedures, and operative data were comparable between groups. The use of blood products tended to be more in the TA group, despite the fact that the aprotinin group had longer CPB duration. Thirty-day mortality was 5 of 48 (10.4%) in the aprotinin group versus 5 of 36 (13.9%) in the TA group (p = 0.44). Neurologic, cardiac, and respiratory dysfunctions were comparable as well as intensive care unit and hospital stay. Serum creatinine increased significantly postoperatively in both groups, with more patients in the aprotinin group developing stage 1 postoperative renal dysfunction based on Acute Kidney Insufficiency Network criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for postoperative renal dysfunction including preoperative creatinine clearance, blood transfusion, and sepsis. Throughout the study, both drugs were available for use, allowing selective bias for providers. CONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin appeared more effective in reducing blood product use after thoracic aortic surgery in this limited cohort. Aprotinin use also appeared to be associated with postoperative renal dysfunction. The choice of antifibrinolytic appeared to not be associated with cardiac, neurologic, or respiratory outcomes or survival after thoracic aortic surgery requiring DHCA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: In a prospective study at Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey, outcomes were compared for 35 IUTs carried out between 2005 and 2010 in 19 pregnancies that were complicated by Rhesus D hemolytic disease with severely hydropic fetuses. Results: There was no correlation between the number of IUTs and the duration of phototherapy or number of exchange transfusions. After delivery, 36% (7/19) of neonates tested positive in a direct Coombs test and their requirement for exchange transfusion was higher than that of neonates who tested negative. The neonatal survival rate was 73.7%. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 78%, and the median duration of neonatal unit stay was 4 days (range, 1-77 days). Only 1 newborn had hearing impairment. Conclusion: IUT is a unique, gold standard treatment for severely hydropic fetuses. When treated optimally with IUT, fetuses with severe hydrops showed no increased risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Factors affecting the survival of hydropic fetuses after IUT, and whether the number of IUTs performed affects the number of exchange transfusions required remain unclear. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains an important issue, with high in-hospital mortality rate. The use of mechanical circulatory support is increasing while inotropes are associated with adverse events, lack of efficacy and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption [1]. We report our single centre experience about MCS with the Impella 5.0 device in CS. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed all the Impella 5.0 implantations indicated for CS from 2008 (first case) to the end of 2013. All clinical parameters, treatments, complications and outcome are described as median [25 and 75 percentile]. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon test and p < 0.05 considered as significant. Results. 40 patients (age: 57yr [49-63]) in severe CS (SOFA: 11 [9-14]) had an Impella 5.0 support device: 25 as a single support strategy (SSS) and 15 as a combined support strategy with VA-ECMO (CSS). CS aetiologies were: postcardiotomy (n = 7), acute myocardial infarction (n = 17), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 12) and others (n = 2). The duration of support with Impella was 7 days [5-10] and ICU stay was 22 days [9-33]. The cardiothoracic ratio decreased from 0.58 [0.52-0.66] before Impella to 0.54 [0.49-0.59] at day 2 (p = 0.001). The inotrope score decreased rapidly from 9.0 [0.6-13.6] before Impella to 1.0 [0.0-8.9] 6 hours after implantation (p = 0.022) indicating a fast weaning of inotropes. During support, we observed major device malfunction (n = 4), malposition (n = 8) with successful bedside repositioning, no bleeding requiring surgery but 32 patients needing transfusion, ischaemic events (n = 3) and device related infection (n = 7). A cardiac recovery or a bridge to LVAD or heart transplantation was possible for 73% of patients. The survival rates at day 28 and month 6 were respectively 65% and 50% without difference between SSS and CSS. Discussion. Impella 5.0 in CS offers a cardiac outflow supply with fast weaning of inotropes and may facilitate myocardial recovery and better outcome or bridge to LVAD and heart transplantation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The MD Anderson Cancer Centre reported an overall VTE incidence of 29% (14/49) in patients with Philadelphia positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) treated with Hyper-CVAD and in the absence of ASNase (Vu et al. Cancer Medicine. 2015;4(1):27-35. doi:10.1002/cam4.332). The VTE incidence in adult Ph+ ALL patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor plus the pediatric-inspired regimen modified from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL protocol remains unclear. We have previously compared the incidence of VTE in adults with Ph+ ALL treated with or without ASNase during the intensification phase of the modified DFCI treatment. This study suggested that patients with Ph+ve ALL experience high incidence of VTE, even in the absence of ASNase, and that this risk is not restricted to the intensification phase. As ASNase was omitted from the protocol due to toxicity since 2008, in this report, we provide further insight into the risk of VTE in adults with Ph+ ALL during the entire ASNase-free DFCI treatment course. Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of sequential Ph+ ALL patients treated at Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PMCC) from 2008-2018 with an imatinib-containing DFCI protocol-based regimen that omitted ASNase. VTE events were recorded from the time of diagnosis to the end of modified DFCI treatment, including at the time of allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Co-variants of age, sex, weight, BMI, Padua score, white blood cell count, and platelet count were also collected. Statistical analyses were performed using the 2-tailed t test. Results: Overall, 130 patients were included for analysis; none received prophylactic anticoagulation. Among the 130 Ph+ ALL patients treated with the modified DFCI protocol, 28 (21.5%) patients had at least 1 VTE events from diagnosis to the end of treatment. The mean age of patients with and without VTE were 56.8 and 49.0 years, respectively (p=0.014) (Table 1). The majority of the VTE events occurred during active treatment, with 9 (7.0%), 11 (8.5%), and 4 (3.1%) occurring during induction, intensification, and maintenance, respectively (Figure 1). Only four patients (3.1%) presented with VTE at the time of diagnosis. Of all VTE events, 14 (50%) were DVT and/or PE, 12 (43%) were line-related, and 2 (7%) involved a cardiac thrombus (Table 2). The average Padua score for these patients was 5.4 with a range of 3-10. All VTE events were treated with low weight molecular heparin (LMWH), with 2 patients experiencing a recurrent episode within a year while on LMWH treatment. Bleeding following anticoagulation was rare. One patient experienced a major bleeding into the psoas muscle while on LMWH plus platelet transfusion for a right atrial clot during the induction phase in ICU. No other significant bleeding event was observed. Conclusion: VTE was observed in more than 20% of adults with Ph+ ALL patients treated with imatinib plus a modified DFCI pediatric ALL protocol. The majority of VTE events occurred during active treatment (induction and intensification), and DVT/PE incidence was similar to that of line-related thrombosis. The high observed VTE incidence suggests that prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered for adult patients with Ph+ ALL even in ASNase-free regimens, especially if additional thromboembolic risk factors are present.

Materials and methods: The case report was based on data recorded in the electronic medical record and literature review. Results: A 62-year-old female diagnosed with CMML in February 2022 during investigation of persistent monocytosis associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL; White blood cell count: 11,860/mm3 (69/0/0/9/20); Platelets: 45,000/mm3. BCR-ABL and JAK2 tests were negative. Bone marrow examination revealed erythroid and granulocytic hypercellularity with dysplastic changes. Megakaryocytes were hypolobulated. The patient presented with a left subdural hematoma following a mild traumatic brain injury in October 2022, requiring neurosurgical intervention. At that time, coagulation profile and platelet levels were normal. In December 2022, she experienced headaches again, with a subdural hematoma on the right side without any history of local trauma. The hematoma was drained once more, and laboratory tests continued to show normal platelet levels and coagulation profile. After discharge, the patient presented with neurological symptoms in January 2023, and a new right-sided subdural hematoma required two additional surgical interventions. Structural abnormalities were not detected on imaging exams. Given the recurrent episodes of severe intracranial hemorrhage with a risk of herniation, the hypothesis of platelet dysfunction associated with CMML was considered, and platelet transfusion was performed. After this intervention, there were no further bleeding episodes, and subsequent platelet aggregation testing confirmed hypoaggregation with collagen, ristocetin at a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL, adrenaline, and arachidonic acid. In outpatient follow-up, the patient showed an increase in white blood cell count and anemia with thrombocytopenia, and she received the AZAVIT-ABCDEF protocol (azacitidine, erythropoietin, filgrastim associated with high doses of vitamin B1, C, and D3) after signing the informed consent. There was no recurrence of central nervous system bleeding, and the leukocytosis and monocytosis were controlled. Discussion: CMML is a condition characterized by persistent monocytosis associated with dysplastic morphology in the bone marrow and can exhibit features of either myelodysplastic neoplasms or chronic myeloproliferative diseases. It is associated with various mutations, including the TET2 gene mutation, which occurs in up to 60% of patients and appears to lead to mild platelet dysfunction. Platelet transfusions stopped the intracranial hemorrhage, and high doses of vitamin C possibly restored the function of the TET2 gene. Conclusion: Advanced in molecular studies may further elucidate the heterogeneity of these myeloid disorders with uncertain clinical behavior and assist in therapeutic decision-making. The patient in this case was diagnosed with CMML and presented with recurrent subdural hematomas in the context of platelet dysfunction, with bleeding cessation achieved through platelet transfusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We report on a stroke patient with neurogenic fever due to injury of hypothalamus, demonstrated by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Patient concerns:A 28-year-old male patient was admitted to the rehabilitation department of university hospital at 30 months after onset. Brain MRI showed leukomalactic lesions in hypothalamus, bilateral medial temporal lobe, and bilateral basal ganglia. He showed intermittent high body temperature (maximum:39.5°C, range:38.5-39.2°C), but did not show any infection signs upon physical examination or after assessing his white blood cell count and inflammatory enzyme levels such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. In addition, 8 age-matched normal (control) subjects (4 male, mean age: 26.6 years, range: 21-29years) were enrolled in the study.Diagnosis:Intraventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.Interventions:He underwent extraventricular drainage and ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus.Outcomes:DTI was performed at 30 months after onset, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained for hypothalamus. The FA and ADC values of patient were lower and higher, respectively, by more than two standard deviations from control values. Injury of hypothalamus was demonstrated in a stroke patient with neurogenic fever.Lessions:Our results suggest that evaluation of hypothalamus using DTI would be helpful in patients show unexplained fever following brain injury.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Disease severity is influenced by an exacerbated immune response, characterized by high pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Inhibition of AKT can potentially suppress pathological inflammation, cytokine storm and platelet activation associated with COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to investigate the rs2494746 and rs1130214 variants in the AKT1 gene associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples and sociodemographic data from 508 individuals with COVID-19, measuring plasma cytokine concentrations using ELISA and genotyped the AKT1 variants. RESULTS: The rs2494746-C allele was associated with severity, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. The C allele at rs1130214 was linked to increased TNF and D-dimer levels. Moreover, both variants exhibited an increased cumulative risk of disease severity, ICU admission, and mortality caused by COVID-19. In the predictive analysis, the rs2494746 obtained an accuracy of 71%, suggesting a high probability of the test determining the severity of the disease. DISCUSSION: Our findings contribute to understanding the influence of the AKT1 gene variants on the immunological damage in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Establishment of a blood conservation program involving the pre-, intra-, and post-operative stages for all patients may lead to minimized need for blood transfusion in all patients. Methods: Pre-operatively all JW patients were treated with high dose erythropoietin 500 U/kg twice a week. JW patients were compared to like non-JW patients from the congenital cardiac database, two per JW to serve as control. Blood use, ventilation time, bypass time, hematocrit pre-operative, first in intensive care unit (ICU), and at discharge, and 24-hour chest drainage were compared. Preoperative huddle, operating room huddle and postoperative bedside handoff were done with the congenital cardiac surgeon, perfusionist, anesthesiologist, intensive care team in all patients for goal alignment. Results: Five JW patients (mean weight 24.4 24.9 Kg, range 6.3-60 Kg) were compared to 10 non-JW patients (weight 22.9 22.2 Kg, range 6.9-67.8 Kg). There was no difference in bypass, cross clamp, time to extubation (0.8 versus 1.7 hours), peak inotrope score (1.8 versus 2.0), or chest drainage. No JW patient received blood product compared to 30% of the non-JW. Pre-operative Hct was statistically greater for the JW patients (46.1 3.3% versus 36.7 4.6%, p< 0.001), and ICU and discharge Hct were also higher for the JW (37 1.8% vs 33.8 7.4%, and 41 8.1% versus 32.8 7.4%). All patients had similar blood draws during the hospitalization (JW x 5 mL/admission vs. non-JW 6 mL/admission).

The pathophysiology of TBI is commonly classified into 2 processes. Primary injury describes the structural injuries sustained from mechanical forces of the initial impact. Secondary injury describes the physiological processes that follow, including intracranial hypertension and ischemia. The former is addressed through public health awareness and prevention, whereas the latter is the focus of inhospital management and a significant body of research. In 2007, the Brain Trauma Foundation published its latest edition of guidelines on the management of patients with severe TBI based on the best available evidence. Parameters for the most common aspects of management are covered with accompanying recommendations (i.e, level I, II, or III) based on the strength of the underlying data. Still, several areas of controversy remain. Hypertonic solutions to manage intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygen monitors, transfusion thresholds, and the role of decompressive hemicraniectomy for intractable intracranial pressures are topics of considerable debate. Clinical trials of a number of promising pharmacotherapies are ongoing as are 2 phase III randomized trials of decompressive craniectomy. Ongoing and future trials in TBI should be conducted using the best possible methodologies to avoid the clinical futility found in past trials of promising therapies. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The baby displayed classic symptoms of shaken baby syndrome, including subdural haemorrhage, cytotoxic cerebral oedema, and bilateral retinal hemorrhages. Child protection services were informed, but both the parents and the nanny denied any involvement. In the subsequent weeks, the baby developed three other episodes of new subdural bleeding and a medico-legal investigation was started into the origin of the repeated subdural bleeding. Eventually, platelet aggregation tests and electron microscopy diagnosed a delta-storage pool disease; that is, a haemostatic disorder involving dense granules of the platelets. Initial minor blunt trauma may have resulted in subdural bleeding, while subsequent retinal haemorrhage could have been facilitated by the underlying haemostatic disorder. Delta-storage pool disease should be considered as a possible mimic of abusive head trauma similar to other rare conditions such as Menkes disease and type 1 glutaric aciduria.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

These experiments tested the hypothesis that chelation of intracellular calcium with the cell-permeant calcium chelator, 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetracetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), decreases smooth muscle contraction in response to agents that cause contraction by increasing intracellular calcium. Effects of BAPTA-AM on vasoconstriction induced by KCl, prostaglandin F(2α) (PGF(2α)), caffeine, and erythrocyte hemolysate were tested on monkey basilar artery under isometric tension. BAPTA-AM, 30 and 100 μmol/L, caused a significant decrease in resting tension in rings with and without endothelium (30 μmol/L; 8 ± 6% [n.s.] and 14 ± 5%, 100 μmol/L; 19 ± 3% and 32 ± 6%,p < 0.05, paired t test). Contractions to caffeine were significantly decreased by 30 μmol/L BAPTA-AM and were abolished at 100 μmol/L in rings with and without endothelium (p < 0.05). BAPTA-AM, 100 μmol/L, competitively inhibited contractions to PGF(2α). BAPTA-AM, 100 μmol/L, significantly decreased the maximum contractions to KCl in rings with and without endothelium (p < 0.05). There were no significant effects of BAPTA-AM on contractions induced by hemolysate in rings with endothelium but in rings without endothelium, BAPTA-AM, 100 μmol/L, significantly inhibited contractions. In rings with endothelium contractions to hemolysate could be significantly reduced by BAPTA-AM plus indomethacin or indomethacin alone, suggesting that hemolysate releases an eicosanoid from the endothelium by a pathway that is not inhibited by BAPTA. These results suggest that the ability of BAPTA-AM to inhibit smooth muscle contractions will depend on the agonists mediating the contraction. In response to erythrocyte hemolysate, loading of endothelial cells with BAPTA- AM increases the release of a vasoconstricting eicosanoid from these cells that counteracts the decreased contraction caused by loading of smooth muscle cells with BAPTA-AM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM; Haemonetics) evaluates the degree of platelet function inhibition through the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and arachidonic acid (AA) pathways. We hypothesized that ADP and AA inhibition would improve with the transfusion of platelets in patients with TBI. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted at a Level I trauma center of all patients presenting with TBI from December 2019 to December 2020. Per a practice management guideline, a platelet mapping assay was obtained on all patients with TBI upon admission. If ADP or AA was found to be inhibited (>60%), the patient was transfused 1 unit of platelets and a repeat platelet mapping assay was ordered. Demographic data, laboratory values, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Over the 13-month study period, 453 patients with TBI underwent TEG-PM with a protocol adherence rate of 66.5% resulting in a total of 147 patients who received platelets for ADP and/or AA inhibition; of those, 107 underwent repeat TEG-PM after platelets were administered. With the administration of platelets, ADP (p < 0.0001), AA (p < 0.0001), and MA (p = 0.0002) all significantly improved. Of 330 patients with TBI not taking antiplatelet medications, 50.9% showed inhibition in ADP and/or AA. If AA or ADP inhibition was noted on admission, mortality was increased (p = 0.0108). If ADP improved with platelet administration, the need for neurosurgical intervention was noted to decrease (p = 0.0182). CONCLUSION Patients with TBI and platelet inhibition may benefit from the administration of platelets to correct platelet dysfunction. Thromboelastography with platelet mapping may be implemented in the initial workup of patients presenting with TBI to assess platelet dysfunction and provide prognostic information, which may guide treatment.

A retrospective descriptive analysis from Jul 2005 to Jun 2010 was carried out in a tertiary care academic referral centre. Main outcome measures were frequency, indications, associated risk factors, maternal morbidity, maternal and fetal mortality associated with emergency obstetric hysterectomy. There were 41 cases of obstetric hysterectomy over the study period and the frequency of obstetric hysterectomy was 22.9/10,000 births. The incidence of hysterectomy for vaginal delivery was 0.017% and for caesarean section was 0.318%. Maximum number of patients (36.5%) were in the age group 26-30 years. 60.9% patients were antenatally unbooked emergency cases. It was most common in para two (46.3%) followed by para four or more (26.8). Main indications for obstetric hysterectomy were rupture uterus and postpartum haemorrhage (31.7% each) followed by morbidly adherent placenta (21.9%). All women required blood transfusion, 26 (63.42%) were anaemic, 5 (12.19%) required ICU stay. There was one maternal mortality and varied morbidity pattern. 12 fetal mortalities were noted, including 9 for uterine rupture, 2 for placenta previa in scarred uterus and one in obstructed labor case. Emergency obstetric hysterectomy still remains a life saving procedure and complications can be minimized by timely and thoughtful decision. Unnecessary delay or undue haste increase maternal morbidity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Heparin is an anticoagulant with anti-inflammatory properties. Unfractionated heparin has been found to be protective in experimental models of ALI. We hypothesized that an intravenous therapeutic dose of unfractionated heparin would favorably influence outcome of critically ill patients diagnosed with ALI. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral center in the Netherlands between November 2004 and October 2007 were screened. Patients who developed ALI (consensus definition) were included. In this cohort, the impact of heparin use on mortality was assessed by logistic regression analysis in a propensity matched case-control design. RESULTS: Of 5,561 admitted patients, 2,138 patients had a length of stay > 48 hours, of whom 723 were diagnosed with ALI (34%), of whom 164 received intravenous heparin. In a propensity score adjusted logistic regression analysis, heparin use did not influence 28-day mortality (odds ratio 1.23 [confidence interval 95% 0.80-1.89], nor did it affect ICU length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of therapeutic doses of intravenous unfractionated heparin was not associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients diagnosed with ALI. Heparin treatment did not increase transfusion requirements. These results may help in the design of prospective trials evaluating the use of heparin as adjunctive treatment for ALI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Diagnosis of coronary vasospastic angina may be difficult given episodic symptoms, therefore inpatient telemetry monitoring is a beneficial modality to record transient EKG changes. Case A 63 year old male who was admitted for an acute left MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) cerebrovascular accident with his course complicated by episodes of chest pain. An EKG during his first episode of stuttering chest pain showed an anterolateral wall STEMI (ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction). He was rushed to the catheterization lab for an emergent left heart catheterization and had a total occlusion in the LAD. A DES (Drug Eluting Stent) was placed. The next day the patient complained of chest pain and repeat EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior lead. Patient underwent a repeat emergent left heart catheterization which was normal. Few hours after his second catheterization, the patient complained of sudden onset crushing substernal chest pain again and the telemetry monitor showed junctional bradycardia. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia with ST elevations and complete resolution of the ST changes in minutes. He was started on nitroglycerin and verapamil for transient coronary vasospasms. He was monitored for an additional 48 hours in the CCU (Coronary Care Unit) and discharged on verapamil and dual-anti platelet therapy. Decision-making The patient&apos;s typical chest pain and EKG changes with ST elevations, an emergent left heart catheterization was warranted. His following episodes of chest pain were transient and telemetry monitor showed junctional bradycardia rhythm with each episode. Given the transient nature, he was diagnosed with coronary vasospastic angina and treated with verapamil. Conclusion A prompt diagnosis of coronary vasospasm is critical as initiation of therapy can prevent further coronary events including life threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Telemetry monitoring can be crucial to diagnose transient rhythm changes during coronary vasospasm and may hint towards the culprit vessel involved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) allows a reduction of the negative effects associated with conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC). In this study, the impact of the MECC on outcome of anemic patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was assessed. Between January 2004 and December 2011, 1,945 consecutive patients with preoperative anemia underwent isolated CABG using CECC (44.8%) or MECC (55.2%). The cutoff point for anemia was 13 g/dl for men and 12 g/dl for women. The postoperative creatine kinase and lactate levels were significantly lower in the MECC group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in postoperative blood loss between the groups. However, the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion requirements were significantly lower in the MECC group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, MECC patients had lower incidences of postoperative acute renal failure, and low cardiac output syndrome, shorter intensive care unit lengths of stay and reduced 30-day mortality (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a reduced postoperative mortality, lower transfusion requirements, and less renal and myocardial damage encourage the use of MECC for CABG, especially in the specific high-risk subgroup of patients with anemia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with cAAAs treated electively by OR or F/B-EVAR between January 2010 and February 2017 was conducted. Demographics of the patients, cardiovascular risk factors, procedure time, number of vessels incorporated, radiation dose, estimated blood loss, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS were recorded. End points included target vessel patency, aneurysm rupture, freedom from reintervention, and major adverse events (MAEs). RESULTS: During this period, 153 patients (OR, 69; F/B-EVAR, 84) underwent repair of cAAA. The majority were male (OR, 55; F/B-EVAR, 64), with a mean age of 75.8 ± 7.6 years (F/B-EVAR) and 71.2 ± 7.9 years (OR). Patients in the F/B-EVAR group were more likely to be American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 and 4 (60% vs 0%; P < .001) and had a higher median Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery comorbidity severity score (15 vs 7; P < .001). A total of 235 vessels were targeted in the F/B-EVAR group, with a technical success of 97.6%. Thirty-one patients in the OR group required concomitant renal artery revascularization. Transfusion requirements (100% vs 1.2%), MAEs (40.6% vs 13.1%), procedure length (304 minutes vs 140 minutes), estimated blood loss (2246 mL vs 165 mL), ICU LOS (3 days vs 1 day), and hospital LOS (7 days vs 2 days) were higher (P < .001) in the OR group compared with the F/B-EVAR group. The 30-day mortality was 2.9% and 2.4% (P = .84) in the OR group and F/B-EVAR group, respectively. Supraceliac clamp site was associated with increased incidence of postoperative renal insufficiency. A decrease in procedure time, contrast volume, fluoroscopy time, and fluoroscopy dose was noted in the F/B-EVAR group with increasing experience even as case complexity increased. More patients were discharged home after F/B-EVAR (97.6% vs 59.4%; P < .001). With a mean follow-up of 31 months (F/B-EVAR, 17 months; OR, 48 months), the rate of secondary intervention was 3.7% and 5.8% (P = NS) for F/B-EVAR and OR, respectively. Freedom from branch instability and reintervention was 99% (95% confidence interval, 96.2%-99.8%) and 96% (95% confidence interval, 87.1%-98.6%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this ""real-world"" experience suggest that the use of F/B-EVAR for the treatment of cAAAs in high-risk surgical patients is safe and effective and has comparable short-term results to those of low-risk patients undergoing OR.

Recent imaging advances made its diagnosis easier. Its prognosis impact is not yet well established. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic features of posttraumatic DAI and to study its prognosis impact on mortality and outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale. Methods: This is a retrospective study over a 4-year period (2004-2007) of 124 patients admitted for head trauma. Demographic, clinical, biological, and radiologic findings were recorded at admission and during intensive care unit stay. Results: Mean age (±standard deviation) was 28 years ± 15.8 years. Cranial computed tomography scan was sufficient enough to diagnose DAI in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 105 patients with a delay of 7.7 days ± 8.6 days. Most patients were classified as stage II (49.5%) or stage III (44.8%) according to Gentry's classification. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher mortality were dysautonomia (p = 0.018; odds ratio [OR] = 4.17), hyperglycemia ≥8 mmol/L (p = 0.001; OR = 3.84) on intensive care unit admission, and subdural hematoma (p = 0.031; OR = 3.99), whereas factors associated to poor outcome according to Glasgow Outcome Scale score were Glasgow Coma Scale score <8 (p = 0.032, OR = 3.55), secondary systemic injuries score ≥3 (p = 0.034, OR = 2.83), hyperglycemia ≥8 mmol/L (p = 0.002, OR = 5.55), and DAI count ≥6 (p = 0.035, OR = 3.33). In patients with pure DAI, the absence of consciousness recovery was the unique independent factor of mortality (p < 0.001, OR = 116.4), whereas only transfusion need was an independent factor of poor outcome (p = 0.017, OR = 4.44). Conclusion: Dysautonomia, hyperglycemia, and subdural hematoma are the main factors associated to higher mortality when DAIs are diagnosed, whereas a DAI count ≥6 is associated to poor outcome. Magnetic resonance imaging classification did not have a prognosis value even in patients with pure DAI.

Methods A retrospective analysis of 2,575 patients undergoing their first documented cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was conducted. Perioperative variables were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used for determining the association between the development of AKI and risk factors. Multiple Cox-proportional hazards modeling was performed to evaluate the impact of AKI on the mortality in the intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. Results Of 2,575 patients, 931 (36%) developed AKI. A total of 30 (1.2%) patients required renal replacement therapy. In the multivariate analysis, mechanical ventilation duration (OR1.446, 95% CI 1.195-1.749, p< 0.001), CPB duration of ≥1110 min (OR 1.314, 95% CI 1.072-1.611, p=0.009), erythrocytes transfusion (OR 1.078, 95% CI 1.050-1.106, p<0.001), and postoperative body temperature greater than 38℃ within 3 days (OR 1.234, 95% CI 1.018-1.496, p=0.032) were independent risk factors for CSA-AKI, while ulinastatin use was associated with a reduced incidence of CSA-AKI (OR 0.694, 95% CI 0.557-0.881, p=0.006). CSA-AKI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR: 2.218, 95% CI 1.161-4.238, p=0.016), especially in patients needing renal replacement therapy (adjusted HR: 18.683, 95% CI 8.579-40.684, p< 0.001). Conclusion Mechanical ventilation duration, erythrocytes transfusion, and postoperative body temperature above 38℃ within 3 days were considered independent risk factors for CSA-AKI.

Acupuncture group; Group A and Control group: Group C. In this study, the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, comorbidities, left ventricular ejection/fraction (E/F), cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPBS, min), aortic cross‐clamp time (ACCS, min). , operation duration, amount of cardioplegia, lowest body temperature will be recorded. Electroacupuncture will be applied to the patients for 30 minutes by the conductor of the study, who is an acupuncturist experienced in electroacupuncture, on the day before surgery and on the day of surgery.The placement of the needles will be applied to a depth of 1‐2 cm, depending on the thickness of the local tissues, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine standards.The EA parameter will be set to a frequency of 2 HZ/100 HZ at a current that the patients' tolerance is best within the range of 0.5 mA to 1.2 mA and will be electrically stimulated for 30 minutes until the patient feels ""Teh Chi"" ""heaviness, numbness and swelling"". No acupuncture procedure will be applied to the patients in the control group.Routine anesthesia and surgery will be applied. All operations will be performed by the same surgical and anesthesia team. Patients will undergo radial artery catheterization and be monitored.Anesthesia will be provided using midazolam, fentanyl and rocuronium bromide. Sevoflurane will be used as an anesthetic agent for the maintenance of general anesthesia. Rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg.kg‐1) will be administered every 30 minutes. A median sternotomy will be performed on each patient.Heparin will be administered at 300‐500 units kg‐1 and will be neutralized with 1‐1.3 mg protamine sulfate. The type and amount of cardioplegia used will be recorded. During the procedure, an activated clotting time of >400 seconds and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60 mmHg will be ensured. By applying PRAM, a minimally invasive advanced hemodynamic parameters monitoring system in our study (MostCare®, Vygon, Vytech), the data we will measure will be kept within reference ranges as much as possible. Noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine and glyceryl trinitrate (perlinganite) will be used to maintain within these reference ranges.Hemodynamic data we will measure by applying PRAM; Dicrotic Pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), cardiac cycle efficiency, the maximal slope of systolic upstroke (dp/dtmax), arterial elastance, pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, values. These values will be recorded as baseline values when the patients are taken to the operating table.In additionally, These values will be recorded at 10‐20‐30‐40‐50‐60 minutes after the patient has undergone sternotomy and at 10‐20‐30‐40‐50‐60 minutes after the patient leaves the pump.At these times, intra‐group and inter‐group comparisons will be made. During these time units, hemoglobin and hematocrit values will also be recorded.These values will be tried to be kept within the normal reference range. Intraoperative inotropic agent use scores will be calculated. In addition, preoperative heart rhythm (sinus or atrial fibrillation) and postoperative heart rhythm will be recorded.BIS score will be kept between 40‐50. After the surgery, each patient will be taken to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit. Blood samples for measurement of troponin I, ischemic modified albumin (IMA), interleukin 6, interleukin 10 will be taken from the radial artery before aortic cross‐clamping (as baseline value before sternotomy) and at 1st hour, 6th hour, 12th hour, 24th hour and after removal of the aortic cross‐clamp. The fluid, blood transfusion and platelet products taken throughout the operation will be recorded. The amount of blood planned to be taken in the study was determined to be at least 5 ml each time in order to study the relevant parameters. Considering that the patient will be hemodynamically supported during coronary bypass surgery, the total amount of blood to be taken during this time period related to the study is not expected to cause any undesirable changes in the patient's hemodynamic and biochemical aspects. Postoperative data; duration of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (time intubated, min), duration of stay in the intensive care unit. Postoperative complications and the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) will be recorded. Inotropic agents used at 1 hour, 6th hour, 12th hour and 24th hour in the intensive care unit will be recorded and inotropic scores will be calculated. According to the inotropic scoring method used in this study, it will be calculated as dopamine (x1), dobutamine (x1), amrinone (x1), epinephrine (x 100) and norepinephrine (x100). Again, total chest drainage volume and urine will be monitored in the intensive care unit, and the duration of intensive care stay (days) will be recorded. Blood samples will be frozen at ‐70°C until the plasma, separated after centrifugation, is assayed. Troponin I concentrations will be measured quantitatively with a one‐step enzyme immunoassay (Access AccuTnI assay system; Beckman‐Coulter, Fullerton, CA) by individuals blinded to group allocation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We sought to determine these in a large cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Qatar and explore the early mortality predictors. Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU at the national referral hospital for COVID-19 patients in Qatar. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with mortality. Results: Between March 7 and July 16, 2020, a total of 1079 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU. The median (IQR) age of patients was 50 (41–59) years. Diabetes (47.3%) and hypertension (42.6%) were the most common comorbidities. In-hospital mortality was 12.6% overall and 25.9% among those requiring mechanical ventilation. Factors independently associated with mortality included older age ([OR]; 2.3 [95% CI; 1.92–2.75] for each 10-year increase in age, p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR; 1.9 [95% CI; 1.02–3.54], p = 0.04), active malignancy (OR; 6.15 [95% CI; 1.79–21.12], p = 0.004), lower platelet count at ICU admission (OR; 1.41 [95% CI; 1.13–1.75] for each 100 × 103/µl decrease, p = 0.002), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at admission (OR; 1.01 [95% CI; 1–1.02] for each 1- point increase, p = 0.016), higher serum ferritin level at admission (OR; 1.05 [(95% CI; 1.02–1.08] for each 500 µg/L increase, p = 0.002), and higher serum bilirubin level at admission (OR; 1.19 [95% CI; 1.04–1.36] for each 10 μmol/L increase, p = 0.01). Conclusions: The mortality rate among critically ill COVID-19 patients is low in Qatar compared to other countries. Older age, chronic kidney disease, active malignancy, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, lower platelet counts, higher serum ferritin levels, and higher serum bilirubin levels are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Case report: A 37/40 parturient with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis and thalasseamia minor presented to triage with 2 day history of recurrent epistaxis. Despite bleeding her vitals and cardiotocograph trace remained stable. Failure to cauterise the bleeding vessel resulted in her being admitted with a nasal pack. As she was stable, decision by the ENT surgeons and Obstetricians was to delay definite management until after delivery by lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) at 39/40. Recurrent epista xis requiring blood transfusion resulted in expedited delivery a week later. Anaesthetic concerns included the safest choice of anaesthesia and location for delivery, airway management and to ensure safest maternal and neonatal outcome.The multi-disciplinary team decision was to proceed on labour ward under general anaesthesia (GA), with a cohort of consultant specialists and theatre teams. This was to improve outcome should a neonatal emergency or a case of post-partum haemorrhage, of which there is an increased incidence in patients with epistaxis,2 arise. A difficult airway trolley and tracheostomy set were also available. Following an uneventful induction and delivery, the ENT surgeons failed to control the bleeding. The nose was packed and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she was later extubated. She returned to theatre 2 days later for an uneventful removal of packs under GA. Discussion: Management of the parturient at term with on-going epista xis is challenging. The decision about the mode of delivery and the choice of anaesthesia, general versus regional, must take into consideration maintenance of cardiovascular stability and avoidance of exacerbating airway compromise following vasopressor therapy. Multi-disciplinary team involvement and careful planning is mandatory to ensure patient safety. Learning points: Multidisciplinary input is required to ensure clinical effectiveness, patient experience and above all safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Reducing the amount of bleeding will reduce the complications subsequent to blood transfusion. The positive effects of coagulation factors, especially fibrinogen, after cardiovascular bypass could have beneficial effects due to reduced bleeding and less need for blood transfusion. However, different studies have reported controversial findings. Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic administration of fibrinogen on blood loss in patients undergoing CABG surgery to achieve more accurate clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a double‐blind randomized clinical trial conducted on 36 patients hospitalized in Ahvaz Imam Khomeini Hospital for coronary artery bypass graft. Patients were randomized to receive either fibrinogen concentrate (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen were checked preoperatively. The transfusion of allogeneic blood components and the volume of blood loss were recorded and compared between the groups. Results: Prophylactic fibrinogen injection reduced the need for blood transfusion, blood products, and postoperative hypotension in the fibrinogen group when compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.005). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the amount of bleeding during operation (P ≤ 0.005). Conclusions: Fibrinogen plays a key role in preventing and stopping the bleeding. Accordingly, fibrinogen decreases bleeding and the need for paced cell in patients in CABG. Given the adverse outcomes of bleeding and coagulopathy in patients undergoing surgery, we conclude that the use of fibrinogen could be beneficial as a prophylactic in hemorrhagic surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Methods: A meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO and the registration number is CRD42021250395. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched based on a defined search strategy to identify eligible studies before March 2021. Data on operative times, blood loss, 30-day mortality, reoperation, length of hospital stay (LOS), overall morbidity, Clavien–Dindo ≥3 complications, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), blood transfusion, delayed gastric emptying (DGE), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH), and oncologic outcomes (R0 resection, lymph node dissection, overall survival, and long-term survival) were subjected to meta-analysis. Results: Overall, we identified 10 retrospective studies enrolling a total of 11,535 patients (1,514 and 10,021 patients underwent LPD and OPD, respectively). The present meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences in overall survival time, 1-year survival, 2-year survival, 30-day mortality, Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complications, POPF, DGE, PPH, and lymph node dissection between the LPD and OPD groups. Nevertheless, compared with the OPD group, LPD resulted in significantly higher rate of R0 resection (OR: 1.22; 95% CI 1.06–1.40; p = 0.005), longer operative time (WMD: 60.01 min; 95% CI 23.23–96.79; p = 0.001), lower Clavien–Dindo grade ≥III rate (p = 0.02), less blood loss (WMD: −96.49 ml; 95% CI −165.14 to −27.83; p = 0.006), lower overall morbidity rate (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85; p = 0.002), shorter LOS (MD = −2.73; 95% CI −4.44 to −1.03; p = 0.002), higher 4-year survival time (p = 0.04), 5-year survival time (p = 0.001), and earlier time to starting adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery (OR: −10.86; 95% CI −19.42 to −2.30; p = 0.01). Conclusions: LPD is a safe and feasible alternative to OPD for patients with PDAC, and compared with OPD, LPD seemed to provide a similar OS.

Objectives: We studied the problems faced during therapeutic plasma Exchange (TPE) and their solutions and formed hospital guidelines for TPE as a result of the lessons learnt. Results: During the study period we did 10 TPE on 5 patients. There were 2 patients with Hyperlipedemic pancreatitis, one patient each with Wilsons disease, Hepatitis E induced Acute Liver Failure (ALF) and Acute Hemolysis with Septicaemia due to Suspected Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). When the call for TPE was sent 4 of the 5 patients were in the intensive care unit on assisted ventilation therefore all procedures were done in the intensive care unit with critical care support and continuous monitoring of critical parameters. All five patients had deranged liver function of various degrees. Renal function was deranged in 3 of the five patients with one patient having a complete renal shut down. All patients had some degree of coagulopathy as per laboratory parameters but none had clinical signs/symptoms of coagulopathy. In view of the coagulopathy fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was used as replacement fluid. The blood volume status of 3 patients was normal but 2 patients had some degree of volume overload as per central venous pressure and X-ray findings. In these patients we restricted the replacement plasma to 80% in consultation with a nephrologist. Maintaining plasma ionized Calcium (Ca++) was a challenge and after a few very low Ca++ reading we resorted to initial Ca++ estimation and a loading dose of Ca chloride followed by hourly estimations and repeat doses as required. Discussion/Conclusion: In view of our institute being a tertiary care referral institute, we have a number of critically ill patients coming for treatment. We have developed protocols in the Transfusion Medicine Department to ensure optimum support for these patients during therapeutic apheresis. The important issues in the protocol are as follows- All procedures are done in the Intensive Care Unit with continuous monitoring and support of critical care staff. Nephrology consultation regarding fluid replacement is done in all cases with renal dysfunction. We have a stringent Ca++ estimation protocol which includes initial estimation followed by hourly repeat estimation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The American College of Surgeons tracks 30 day outcomes using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality Initiative Program (MBSAQIP) database. We examined the short term outcomes of patients that undergo bariatric surgery concomitantly with other operations such as hernia repairs and cholecystectomy to determine the safety of this practice. Methods: The MBSAQIP Public Use File for 2015-2017 was examined for differences in primary bariatric operations vs concurrent procedures (CP). We only used the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for gastric bypass (GB - CPT 43644) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG - CPT 43775) for our primary bariatric cases. We specifically looked for concurrent CPT codes for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), and hernia repairs (HR: ventral, epigastric, incisional and inguinal). We compared operative and post operative characteristics. P was significant at < 0.05. Results: Overall, there were 469,710 cases, of which 15,400 had CP. CP had higher rates of ICU admission (p<0.001), PE (p<0.001), transfusion (p<0.01), acute renal failure (p<0.001) and greater rates of readmission, reoperation and intervention (p<0.001). Operative times were significantly longer for CP (121.6 vs 87.5 min, p<0.001) and had a longer length of stay (1.98 vs 1.72 days). SG had a higher rate of CP vs bypass (65.8% vs 34.2%, p<0.005). Conclusions: There is a higher rate of complications with concurrent procedures in the MBSAQIP database. Length of stay and operative times are increased in concurrent operations.

Box 294, 1400 AG",,"The key role of platelets in pathophysiology of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) has been well recognized. Platelet activation and aggregation, together with tissue factor-pathway activation, lead to acute thrombus formation in the coronary vessels at sites of plaque rupture. Thus, antiplatelet therapy with drugs able to interfere with platelet activation/aggregation represents a cornerstone of ACS treatment in intensive care units and catheterisation labs. Several observational studies have described that residual high platelet reactivity, despite antiplatelet therapy, is associated with increased risk of nonfatal Myocardial Infarction (MI), definite/probable stent thrombosis and cardiovascular mortality. Thus, assessment of platelet function with reliable and reproducible platelet function tests might be crucial to identify patients at high risk of thrombosis or not responding to ongoing antiplatelet strategies. How-ever, despite this promising background, some randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate improvement in outcomes when using platelet function tests for clinical decision-making. This review, after describing platelet biology and pathophysiology of ACS, briefly considers the drugs currently ap-proved for use in patients with ACS or treated by the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Finally, we provide an updated overview of the current methods to evaluate platelet reactivity in the clinical setting of ACS illustrating their potential advantages/limitations in current clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Adverse effects of FFP have been well described, including acute lung injury. However, it is also suggested that a higher amount of FFP decreases mortality in trauma patients requiring a massive transfusion. Furthermore, FFP has an endothelial stabilizing effect in experimental models. We investigated the effect of fresh frozen plasma transfusion on systemic inflammation and endothelial condition. METHODS: A prospective predefined substudy of a randomized trial in coagulopathic non-bleeding critically ill patients receiving a prophylactic transfusion of FFP (12 ml/kg) prior to an invasive procedure. Levels of inflammatory cytokines and markers of endothelial condition were measured in paired samples of 33 patients before and after transfusion. The statistical tests used were paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: At baseline, systemic cytokine levels were mildly elevated in critically ill patients. FFP transfusion resulted in a decrease of levels of TNF-α (from 11.3 to 2.3 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Other cytokines were not affected. FFP also resulted in a decrease in systemic syndecan-1 levels (from 675 to 565 pg/ml, P = 0.01) and a decrease in factor VIII levels (from 246 to 246%, P <0.01), suggestive of an improved endothelial condition. This was associated with an increase in ADAMTS13 levels (from 24 to 32%, P <0.01) and a concomitant decrease in von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels (from 474 to 423%, P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A fixed dose of FFP transfusion in critically ill patients decreases syndecan-1 and factor VIII levels, suggesting a stabilized endothelial condition, possibly by increasing ADAMTS13, which is capable of cleaving vWF.

The blood bank (BB) and neonatology services must provide blood in a timely manner while simultaneously adhering to proper blood banking standards and navigating hospital processes and information systems. As they can occur outside of the controlled setting of a neonatal ICU, neonatal transfusion immediately following birth poses its own unique chal-lenges. We describe here our institution's experience in developing a protocol for these particularly difficult scenarios. Study Design/Method: The need for an inter-departmental protocol addressing immediate-postnatal red blood cell (RBC) transfusions was recognized, specifically in the settings of the delivery room, operating room, and emergency department. Key stakeholders included: BB, neonatology, nursing, emergency, hospital admission/registration, laboratory information systems, and information technology services. Challenges to be addressed involved: 1.) unique identification of an unborn patient, 2.) documenting transfusion for said patient in the immediate post-natal period, 3.) efficient communication to BB, and 4.) rapid provision of unmodified, non-cross-matched RBC units while adhering to regulations and standards set forth by the FDA and accrediting agencies. Through multiple meetings, a protocol was drafted to define the respective roles of the BB and neonatology services. Results/Finding: After several revisions, the protocol outlined the following: Neonatology creates a pending neonatal admission profile in the electronic medical record with two unique identifiers assigned immediately. If transfusion is deemed necessary, neonatology telephones the blood bank for a ""Code Baby Blood""-an unambiguous prompt for this emergent situation. BB is given the neonate's unique identifiers and a request for RBC under emergency release, read back for confirmation. BB issues one whole unit of additive solution packed RBC, group O, Rh-negative, leukoreduced, hemoglobin S negative, non-irradiated, freshest available. If not yet performed, BB performs maternal type and screen-a positive screen prompts immediate follow-up testing of the issued unit. Two timed simulations were conducted to identify areas for improvement. The first was completed in 13 minutes, and the second in 8 minutes. Conclusion: A thoughtful protocol for immediate-postnatal neonatal trans-fusion helps to streamline efforts and decrease confusion among caregivers in these situations. Our experience reflects one possible approach within the physical and logistic limitations of our institution. Future efforts will dis-seminate knowledge of this protocol to all potentially-involved caregivers within the hospital.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all live births in Ohio (2006-2015). Frequency of maternal HCV infection as reported on birth certificates was compared across each year of the study period. Maternal, obstetric, and neonatal characteristics were compared between women with HCV infection in pregnancy with those without HCV infection. Multivariate logistic regression estimated the relative association between HCV infection and various maternal characteristics and obstetric outcomes. RESULTS: During the 10-year study period, there were 7,069 reported cases of maternal HCV infection at the time of delivery among 1,463,506 (0.5%) live births in Ohio. The rate of maternal HCV infection increased 631% between 2006 and 2015, from 1.6 to 11.7 cases per 1,000 live births (relative risk [RR] 7.6, CI 6.6-8.7, P<.001). After adjusting for various confounders, demographic characteristics associated with HCV infection included cigarette smoking (adjusted RR 8.6, CI 8.0-9.1), Medicaid insurance (adjusted RR 3.6, CI 3.3-3.8), and white, non-Hispanic race (adjusted RR 3.2, 95% CI 2.9-3.5). Coinfection during pregnancy with hepatitis B, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus infection was also associated with maternal HCV infection. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes associated with maternal HCV infection included cesarean delivery, fetal intolerance of labor, preterm birth, maternal intensive care unit admission, blood transfusion, small for gestational age (less than the 10th percentile), neonatal intensive care unit admission, need for assisted neonatal ventilation, and infant death. CONCLUSION: Maternal HCV infection has increased more than sevenfold over the past decade in Ohio. Our findings highlight a dramatic rise in maternal HCV infection that parallels the opioid epidemic within Ohio and in neighboring Appalachian states.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

The plasma levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and erythrocyte levels of GSH-Px were investigated in 45 autistic children and compared with 41 normal controls. Levels of erythrocyte SOD, erythrocyte and plasma GSH-Px were assayed spectrophotometrically. Activities of erythrocyte SOD, erythrocyte and plasma GSH-Px in autistic children were significantly lower than normals.

Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis who received one unit of PCT during their hospitalization in a general intensive care unit during 2000-2019. A control group was established by matching each of these patients to a patient who did not receive PCT. We calculated the mean values of urinary bladder temperature for the 24 h before and 24 h after PCT. To evaluate the effect of PCT on body core temperature, multivariable analyses using a mixed linear regression model were performed. Results: The study comprised 1,100 patients who received one unit of PCT and 1,100 matched patients. The mean temperature before PCT was 37.3°C. Immediately from initiation of PCT, body temperature decreased, to a minimum of 37.0°C. During the 24 subsequent hours, the temperature increased gradually and consistently, until a peak temperature of 37.4°C. In a linear regression model, body core temperature increased by a mean 0.06°C in the first 24 h after PCT and decreased by a mean 0.65°C for every 1.0°C increase before PCT. Conclusions: Among critically ill patients with sepsis, PCT itself causes only mild and clinically insignificant temperature changes. Thus, significant changes in core temperature during the 24 h after PCT may indicate an unusual clinical event that requires clinicians' immediate attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Included"", ""Takahiro""=>""Included""}",,"",,

However, no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to guide BT strategies in cardiac patients, and the haemoglobin threshold at which BT becomes necessary is unknown. We sought to prospectively examine the current practice of BT in 2 tertiary CCU's without a specific BT policy. METHODS: From July 2009 to September 2011, physicians were asked to document the baseline characteristics of their patients, primary reason for BT, and probable site(s) of bleeding when BT was ordered. Information regarding duration of hospitalisation and in-hospital mortality was tracked. RESULTS: Our prospective cohort consisted of 60 patients (mean age 71.1 ± 12.1 years, 37 male). The primary diagnoses for CCU admission were acute coronary syndrome in 38 (63.3%) patients, arrhythmia in 5 (8.3%) patients, and decompensated heart failure in 5 (8.3%) patients. The average systolic blood pressure was 105.6 ± 23.2 mmHg at the time of BT. Vasopressor and/or inotropic agents were being administered in 14 (23.3%) patients, and left ventricular assist devices were present in 7 (11.7%) patients at the time of BT. Cardiac catheterization (n=34, 56.7%) and coronary intervention (n=19, 31.7%) were common before BT. The use of ASA, clopidogrel and heparin within 24 hours prior to BT was 88.3%, 60.0% and 71.7% respectively. The most common site of blood loss was the gastrointestinal system (n=22, 36.7%), but the site of blood loss was unknown in up to 18.3% of patients. «Low haemoglobin» (38.3%) and «ongoing blood loss» (36.7%) were the leading reasons for BT, while only 11.7% of patients received BT for haemo-dynamic instability. The mean haemoglobin level at the time of BT was 79.4± 10.9 g/L, while it was 78.1 ±8.4 g/L for patients with «low haemoglobin» as the indication for BT. The median length of hospitalization was 13 days, and in-hospital mortality was 15.0% amongst patients who received a BT. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving a BT in CCU often required left ventricular supportive therapy. «Low haemoglobin level», not «haemodynamic instability», was the most common reason for BT in CCU. The most common site of blood loss was the gastrointestinal system, but the site of blood loss was unknown in many patients. Patients who received BT had a high rate of mortality. The current study highlights the heterogeneous practice of BT and the need to establish evidence-based practice guidelines for BT in patients with cardiac diseases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Medical ICU. PATIENTS: Twenty-six adult patients with status asthmaticus treated with venovenous extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data and characteristics of current and prior asthma treatments were obtained from the electronic medical record. Mechanical ventilator settings, arterial blood gases, vital signs, and use of vasopressors were collected from the closest time prior to cannulation and 24 hours after initiation of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal settings, including blood flow and sweep gas flow, were collected at 24 hours after initiation of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. Outcome measures included rates of survival to hospital discharge, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support, and complications during extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. Following the initiation of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, blood gas values were significantly improved at 24 hours, as were peak airway pressures, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and use of vasopressors. Survival to hospital discharge was 100%. Twenty patients (76.9%) were successfully extubated while receiving extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support; none required reintubation. The most common complication was cannula-associated deep venous thrombosis (six patients, 23.1%). Four patients (15.4%) experienced bleeding that required a transfusion of packed RBCs. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series to date, use of venovenous extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in patients with status asthmaticus can provide a lifesaving means of support until the resolution of the exacerbation, with an acceptably low rate of complications. Early extubation in select patients receiving extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is safe and feasible and avoids the deleterious effects of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation in this patient population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of morbidity and mortality at the ICU. Prognostic value of several laboratory parameters has been described. An early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis has been shown as a chance to improve outcome. OBJECTIVES. To describe the clinical characteristics of patients admitted in ICU with sepsis and analyse their relation with laboratory values clearance within the first 24 h of admission. METHODS. Patients admitted in the ICU with diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock in 1 year (from May 2009 to May 2010) were included. Age, sex, time of mechanical ventilation, Apache II, SOFA and SAPS II scores on admission were registered. Laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, platelet count and aPTT ratio were prospectively recorded. Lactates at admission and after 24 h were also recorded. Leukocyte clearance was obtained by the difference between the value at 24 h of ICU stay minus the value on ICU admission. Results were compared according to mortality. RESULTS. 73 septic patients were enrolled. Five were excluded because they didn't complete 24 h of staying in ICU. Mean age was 63.4 ± 16.2 years, 18 female and 50 male. ICU length of stay was 11.1 ± 8.3 days and the mean APACHE II score was 20.1 ± 10.3. Mean SAPS II score was 60.6 ± 17.7 with mean SOFA score of 7.1 ± 3.4. According to the clinical outcome, we divided the patients in two groups: survivors and non-survivors. (Table Presented) CONCLUSIONS. In our study we found that increased leukocytes clearance and lower lactates (both at admission and 24 h after admission) were associated with a better outcome in septic patients. Bicarbonate, aPTT ratio, as well as platelet count at admission, weren't associated with an increase in survival. Lactate and leucocytes clearance early in the course of ICU admission for sepsis may indicate an improved outcome compared with those with lower clearance of these parameters.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

We prospectively studied 40 patients aged 11 (8-17) months (median with interquartile range) with a preoperative mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 48 (34-54) mmHg who were considered to be at risk for postoperative pulmonary hypertension. The immediate postoperative pulmonary/systemic mean arterial pressure ratio (PAP/SAP(IPO), mean of first 4 values obtained in the intensive care unit, readings at 2-hour intervals) was correlated directly with PAP/SAP registered in the surgical room just after cardiopulmonary bypass (r = 0.68, p < 0.001). For the entire cohort, circulating levels of 15 inflammatory markers changed after surgery. Compared with patients with PAP/SAP(IPO) ≤ 0.40 (n = 22), those above this level (n = 18) had increased pre- and postoperative serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (p = 0.040), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (p = 0.020), interleukin-6 (p = 0.003), and interleukin-21 (p = 0.047) (panel for 36 human cytokines) and increased mean platelet volume (p = 0.018). Using logistic regression analysis, a PAP/SAP(IPO) > 0.40 and a heightened immediate postoperative serum level of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (quartile analysis) were shown to be predictive of significant postoperative cardiopulmonary events (respective hazard ratios with 95% CIs, 5.07 (1.10-23.45), and 3.29 (1.38-7.88)).

Method: A retrospective study was conducted including 837/990 RBC transfusion requisition forms for children and adolescents (0 to 13 years old) filed in between January 2007 and April 2015 by the pediatricians of the emergency room (ER), infirmary ward and intensive care unit (pICU). Transfusion requisition forms belonging to patients with chronic anemia or acute hemorrhage, as well as incompletes requisition forms, were excluded. Results: Trigger, prescribed volume and subtype of RBC concentrates were adequate in 532 (65.3%), 460 (58.8%) and 805 (96.2%) of the transfusions, respectively. When the clinical picture was considered, prescription adequacy was higher compared to the use of the hemoglobin level alone (70.9% vs. 41%). The pICU had the highest correct trigger percentage (343 [71.6%]; p<0.001) while the ER showed more often adequate prescribed volumes (119 [66.1%]; p=0.020). The most common inadequacy regarding volume was that of prescriptions above the recommendation > 15 mL/kg found in 309 cases (36.9%). Thirty-two (32) RBC subtypes were requested and none were consistent with current recommendations. Conclusion: The results obtained in our study showed that RBC transfusion occurred more appropriately when the clinical picture was taken into account at request. There was a tendency to prescribe higher volumes and RBC subtypes without the justification of current protocols. Hemotherapic teachings at undergraduate level and medical residency must be improved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled study was conducted from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020 at two university hospitals. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups; Group 1 was managed by Assar's technique and Group 2 was managed by Shehata's technique. Operative time, blood loss, operative complications (organ or vessel injury), and postoperative complications (early and late) were reported. Success of the technique, units of blood transfusion, and intensive care unit admissions were recorded. RESULTS: Demographic data in both groups were not significantly different. The mean gestational age at the delivery time was 36 weeks in both groups. Operative time was 120 (100-140) minutes and 75 (60-100) minutes in Assar's and Shehata's techniques, respectively (P < 0.001). Blood loss was higher in Shehata's technique than in Assar's (P < 0.001). Intensive care unit admissions were minimal in both groups. Operative complications were comparable in both groups. The success of Assar's and Shehata's techniques in uterine preservation was 85% and 95%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both techniques were safe and successful in uterine sparing. Therefore, we recommend these techniques for conservative management of PAS.

Our aim was to evaluate the utility of the 4Ts scoring system to predict HIT in multiple ICU settings and to characterize our treatment of these cases. METHODS: Eighty-two patients from multiple ICU settings who underwent laboratory testing for HIT were classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk patients based on retrospectively adjudicated 4Ts scores. These results were compared with platelet-factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (PF4 ELISAs), optical density (OD) values, and serotonin-release assays (SRAs) to assess the utility of the 4Ts score to rule out ICU-related HIT and reduce laboratory and drug expenditures. RESULTS: Of the 82 patients reviewed, only 12 (11.4%) were PF4-positive and only 1 (1.2%) was SRA-positive for HIT. Heparin was discontinued in only 63.4% of patients suspected to have HIT. There were no significant differences in mean day of platelet fall, mean platelet nadir, and mean percent fall in platelet count between PF4-positive and negative patients (all p > 0.2). There was, however, a significantly higher proportion of patients with an intermediate to high 4Ts score in the PF4-positive group than in the PF4-negative group (66% vs. 30%, respectively; p = 0.02). The mean PF4 OD value in patients with intermediate to high 4Ts scores was significantly higher than in patients with low 4Ts scores (0.658 vs. 0.258, respectively; p < 0.001). The negative predictive values of the 4Ts score relative to the PF4 and SRA were 92% and 100%, respectively. The estimated laboratory and pharmacologic cost avoidance potential of the scoring system in this cohort was $21,450. CONCLUSION: Our modified 4Ts scoring system appears to be an effective tool for predicting HIT in the ICU and could avoid significant drug and laboratory expenditures if implemented prospectively. The clinical management of patients suspected of HIT is highly variable at our institution. Clinical protocols and education encouraging the proper identification and treatment of suspected HIT need to be established.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""takashi""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,

Achieving effective platelet inhibition and anticoagulation, with minimal risk, is particularly important in high-risk ACS patients, especially those with cardiogenic shock (CS) or those successfully resuscitated following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), who have a 30-50% risk of death or a recurrent ischaemic event over the subsequent 30 days. There are unique challenges to achieving effective and safe antithrombotic treatment in this cohort of patients that are not encountered in most other ACS patients. This position paper focuses on patients presenting with CS or immediately post-OHCA, of presumed ischaemic aetiology, and examines issues related to thrombosis and bleeding risk. Both the physical and pharmacological impacts of CS, namely impaired drug absorption, metabolism, altered distribution and/or excretion, associated multiorgan failure, co-morbidities and co-administered treatments such as opiates, targeted temperature management, renal replacement therapy and circulatory or left ventricular assist devices, can have major impact on the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic drugs. Careful attention to the choice of antithrombotic agent(s), route of administration, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic drug monitoring and factors that affect drug efficacy and safety, may reduce the risk of sub- or supra-therapeutic dosing and associated adverse events. This paper provides expert opinion, based on best available evidence, and consensus statements on optimising antithrombotic therapy in these very high-risk patients, in whom minimising the risk of thrombosis and bleeding is critical to improving outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shodai""=>""Excluded"", ""Takahiro""=>""Excluded""}",,"",,
