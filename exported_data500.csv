We hypothesized that increased BMI in TTTS is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and vascular pathology. A retrospective study of twin reversed arterial perfusion (n = 4), selective intrauterine growth restriction (n = 10) and TTTS (n = 33) was conducted. Treatment included fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) (n = 35) or Solomon technique (n = 12). Ex vivo placental intravascular injections, immunohistochemistry, and perinatal outcomes were compared by maternal BMI. In pregnancy complicated by TTTS, 16/33 women were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) and 11/33 were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)). Women who were overweight or obese had an increased rate of premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), cesarean delivery, and/or concomitant co-morbidities when compared to the normal weight group. Duration of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission was longer in neonates of overweight/obese women versus normal weight. Placental examination of FLP sites in the obese group showed larger infarcts, increased adipose triglyceride lipase, and a proangiogenic phenotype.

A comparison of the ICON and ABC studies conducted 13 years apart,"['Cavalcante dos Santos, Elaine', 'Bakos, Péter', 'Vincent, Jean-Louis']",Transfusion,60,12,2801-2806,"Background: Optimal transfusion practice remains a matter of ongoing debate despite several large clinical studies. Study Design and Methods: Databases from two observational studies—the Anemia and Blood Transfusion in Critically ill patients (ABC) conducted in 1999 and The Intensive Care Over Nations (ICON) audit conducted in 2012—were compared to evaluate changes in transfusion practice and outcomes over a 13-year period. Results: A total of 3534 patients from the ABC study and 4125 from the ICON study were included in this analysis. ICON patients were more severely ill, with higher APACHE II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores on admission than ABC patients; however, ICU mortality rates were similar (13.5% vs 13.8%, P =.745). The ICU transfusion rate was significantly lower in the ICON study (24% vs 37%, P <.001). APACHE II and SOFA scores were significantly higher in transfused patients in the ICON study than those in the ABC study (APACHE II: 22.0 ± 8.1 vs 16.5 ± 7.9, P <.001; SOFA: 8.4 ± 4.0 vs 6.6 ± 3.7, P <.001), but mortality rates were similar. Twenty-eight day mortality rates for patients who received more than 4 RBC units were lower in the ICON study (33.6% vs 44.8%, P =.006). Conclusion: The transfusion rate in ICU patients decreased during the 13-year period, despite patients being more severely ill in the more recent study; ICU mortality rates remained relatively stable.

Mortality from hyperkalemia increases with large volumes of PRBC transfusion, increased rate of transfusion, and the use of stored PRBCs. Theoretically, hyperkalemia may be complicated by low cardiac output, acidosis, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypothermia. In this study, we focus on transfusion-related hyperkalemia involving only medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients. METHOD: This prospective observational study focuses on PRBC transfusions among MICU patients greater than 18 years of age. Factors considered during each transfusion included patient's diagnosis, indication for transfusion, medical co-morbidities, acid-base disorders, K(+) levels before and after each PRBC transfusion, age of stored blood, volume and rate of transfusion, and other adverse events. We used Pearson correlation and multivariate analysis for each factor listed above and performed a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Between June 2011 and December 2011, 125 patients received a total of 160 units of PRBCs. Median age was 63 years (22 - 92 years). Seventy-one (57%) were females. Sixty-three patients (50%) had metabolic acidosis, 75 (60%) had acute renal failure (ARF), and 12 (10%) had end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Indications for transfusion included septic shock (n = 65, 52%), acute blood loss (n = 25, 20%), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (n = 25, 20%) and preparation for procedures (n = 14, 11%). Baseline K(+) value was 3.9 ± 1.1 mEq/L compared to 4.3 ± 1.2 mEq/L post-transfusion respectively (P = 0.9). During this study period, 4% of patients developed hyperkalemia (K(+) 5.5 mEq/L or above). The mean change of serum potassium in patients receiving transfusion ≥ 12 days old blood was 4.1 ± 0.4 mEq/L compared to 4.8 ± 0.3 mEq/L (mean ± SD) in patients receiving blood 12 days or less old. Sixty-two patients (77.5%) that were transfused stored blood (for more than 12 days) had increased serum K(+); eight (17.7%) patients received blood that was stored for less than 12 days. In both univariate (P = 0.02) and multivariate (P = 0.04) analysis, findings showed that among all factors, transfusion of stored blood was the only factor that affected serum potassium levels (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.91). No difference was found between central and peripheral intravenous access (P = 0.12), acidosis (P = 0.12), ARF (P = 0.6), ESRD (P = 0.5), and multiple transfusions (P = 0.09). One subject developed a sustained cardiac arrest after developing severe hyperkalemia (K(+) = 9.0) following transfusion of seven units of PRBCs. Multivariate logistic regression showed linear correlation between duration of stored blood and serum K(+) (R(2) = 0.889). CONCLUSION: This study assesses factors that affect K(+) in patients admitted to MICU. Results from the study show that rise in serum K(+) level is more pronounced in patients who receive stored blood (> 12 days). Future studies should focus on the use of altered storage solution, inclusion of potassium absorption filters during transfusion and cautious use of blood warmer in patients requiring massive blood transfusions.",2015,Canada,https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr2123w,"{""pmid"": 25883703, ""electronic_issn"": ""1918-3011"", ""print_issn"": ""1918-3003"", ""linking_issn"": ""1918-3003"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101538301"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""Hyperkalemia"", ""Packed red blood cell transfusion"", ""Potassium"", ""Red cell storage""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2015 Jun"", ""dates"": {""accepted"": ""2015-03-11"", ""published"": ""2015-04-18"", ""electronic"": ""2015-04-08""}}"

Reports suggest an association between platelet transfusion and infection. However, there is no large study to have determined whether platelet transfusion in critically ill patients is associated with hospital-acquired infection. METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre study using prospectively maintained databases of two large academic intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia. Characteristics of patients who received platelets in ICUs between 2008 and 2014 were compared to those of patients who did not receive platelets. Association between platelet administration and infection (bacteraemia and/or bacteriuria) was modelled using multiple logistic regression and Cox regression, with blood components as time-varying covariates. A propensity covariate adjustment was also performed to verify results. RESULTS: Of the 18,965 patients included, 2250 (11.9%) received platelets in ICU with a median number of 1 platelet unit (IQR 1-3) administered. Patients who received platelets were more severely ill at ICU admission (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score 65 (SD 29) vs 52 (SD 25), p < 0.01) and had more comorbidities (31% vs 19%, p < 0.01) than patients without platelet transfusion. Invasive mechanical ventilation (87% vs 57%, p < 0.01) and renal replacement therapy (20% vs 4%, p < 0.01) were more frequently administered in patients receiving platelets than in patients without platelets. On univariate analysis, platelet transfusion was associated with hospital-acquired infection in the ICU (7.7% vs 1.4%, p < 0.01). After adjusting for confounders, including other blood components administered, patient severity, centre, year, and diagnosis category, platelet transfusions were independently associated with infection (adjusted OR 2.56 95% CI 1.98-3.31, p < 0.001). This association was also found in survival analysis with blood components as time-varying covariates (adjusted HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.41-2.41, p < 0.001) and when only bacteraemia was considered (adjusted OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.30-4.74, p <0.001). Platelet transfusions remained associated with infection after propensity covariate adjustment.

We hypothesized that late, trauma center (TC) tourniquet use would increase death from hemorrhagic shock compared to early (PH) placement. METHODS All patients arriving to a Level 1, urban TC between October 2008 and January 2016 with a tourniquet placed before (T-PH) or after arrival to the TC (T-TC) were evaluated. Cases were assigned the following designations: indicated (absolute indication [vascular injury requiring repair/ligation, operation within 2 hours for extremity injury, or traumatic amputation] or relative indication [major musculoskeletal/soft tissue injury requiring operation 2-8 hours after arrival, documented large blood loss]) or non-indicated. Outcomes were death from hemorrhagic shock, physiology upon arrival to the TC, and massive transfusion requirements. After univariate analysis, logistic regression was carried out to assess independent predictors of death from hemorrhagic shock. RESULTS A total of 306 patients received 326 tourniquets for injuries to 157 upper and 147 lower extremities. Two hundred eighty-one (92%) had an indication for placement. Seventy percent of patients had a blunt mechanism of injury. T-TC patients arrived with a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP, 101 [86, 123] vs. 125 [100, 145] mm Hg, p < 0.001), received more transfusions in the first hour of arrival (55% vs. 34%, p = 0.02), and had a greater mortality from hemorrhagic shock (14% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.01). When controlling for year of admission, mechanism of injury and shock upon arrival (SBP ≤90 mm Hg or HR ≥120 bpm or base deficit ≤ 4) indicated T-TC had a 4.5-fold increased odds of death compared to T-PH (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.23-16.4, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Waiting until TC arrival to control hemorrhage with a tourniquet was associated with worsened blood pressure and increased transfusion within the first hour of arrival. In routine civilian trauma patients, delaying to T-TC was associated with 4.5-fold increased odds of mortality from hemorrhagic shock.

The objective of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly patients who receive mechanical ventilation for more than 30 days in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) at a university hospital. Methods: We retrospectively examined forty-one elderly patients (≥65 years old) who were receiving mechanical ventilation, from April 2004 to March 2007, for periods exceeding 30 days at the MICU at Eulji University Hospital. Results: The MCU and hospitalmortality rate were 60.9% and 65.9%, respectively. The mean length of the ICU stay was 57.5 days and the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 49.3 days. The most common reason for MICU admission was acute respiratory failure (73.2%), followed by sepsis (12.2%), neurological problems (9.8%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (4.9%). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores were higher for the nonsurvivors than for the survivors (28.0 vs. 25.0, respectively, p=0.03).

7e605d25-8680-4258-b59e-480b9e0ab19f,A case of category five COVID-19 patient transfused with convalescent plasma,"['Zamani, F.', 'Che Ros, F.']",Vox Sanguinis,117,SUPPL 1,260,"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, caused by a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2. It emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China in December 2019. Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used in a number of emerging infections for which there are no proven antivirals, including SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus disease (EVD). It may also be a potentially effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 disease before COVID-19 vaccinations was introduced. In this case report, we described a case of a 59 years old lady with no known medical illness or no known drug allergies and she was diagnosed with Covid-19 with Class 4A (requiring nasal prong) on 8/10/2020, her oxygen saturation was 96% under nasal prong. During her initial admission, she was given favipravir and interferon as alternative treatment for Covid-19. Unfortunately, at 3rd day of illness, her oxygen level deteriorated to 94% under nasal prong (72% from arterial blood gas) thus, she was transferred to intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilation support. The next day, she was intubated as her condition worsen. On 5th day of illness, she was transfused with convalescent plasma and subsequently extubated as she improved clinically. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating a case of category 5 Covid-19 patient at Hospital Tuanku Ja'afar. Methods: The data regarding the patient's clinical information was retrospectively collected from the patient case notes and the laboratory information system. Results: Other than clinically improved, we noted the CT value from tracheal aspirate PCR prior to the transfusion was 24.60 while the CT value 48 h post transfusion showed 31.62.

Plasma exchange replacement fluids in TTP include Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and solvent/detergent treated pooled plasma (SDP), such as Octaplas. SDP is a virus-inactivated, pooled human plasma product with standardized plasma protein content, including ADAMTS13, that has been used in the treatment of TTP. This study evaluates the effectiveness of SDP as compared to FFP in the treatment of acute TTP episodes. Study Design and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing SDP- to FFP-treated patients with suspected acute TTP episodes as a primary admitting diagnosis between December 2014 and December 2019. A total of 16 patients were included in this study. The FFP group consisted of 9 patients (6M/3F, median age 44 years), three of whom had relapsed TTP. The SDP cohort had 7 patients (2M/5F, median age 38 years), one of whom had relapsed TTP. The primary outcomes measured included reported thromboembolic and major bleeding events. Secondary outcomes included number of plasma exchange procedures, adverse effects including neurological changes, transfusion of other blood products, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and changes in laboratory values. Results: There were no adverse transfusion reactions reported in either group. 12 bleeding events were reported from 6 patients in the FFP group and 8 bleeding events from 4 patients in the SDP group (p=0.397). No significant differences were detected in ICU stay, hospital LOS, number of plasma units transfused, daily percentage of change of laboratory values, or changes in neurological status. Conclusions:These data confirm the previously reported efficacy of SDP for treating suspected/confirmed TTP.There were no significant differences in thromboembolic or bleeding events between patients who received FFP as compared to SDP. The non-significant differences observed in laboratory values throughout the duration of plasma exchange procedures as well as adverse reactions and clinical outcomes between both groups confirm the safety of SDP when used interchangeably with FFP for the treatment of TTP.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the transfusion of 1-2 leucocyte-depleted (LD) RBC units and outcomes in patients undergoing open-heart valve surgery. METHODS: The investigation encompassed consecutive patients undergoing open-heart valve surgery at our institution between July the incidence of in-hospital major organ dysfunctions and 1-year mortality (secondary). Propensity score (PS)-adjusted statistical analysis was used to assess the effect of RBC transfusion on end-points. ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.21-4.83;P = 0.99). The two groups showed no significant differences in PS-adjusted ORs for major complications, such as stroke, low cardiac output syndrome, thoracic wound infection and prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 h). The PS-adjusted ORs for prolonged intensive care unit stay (>48 h) were, however, significantly higher in the RBC+ group (OR = 1.34 [95%CI: 1.04-1.72; P = 0.02]) than in the RBC- group. One-year mortality was comparable between groups (PS-adjusted hazard ratio for the RBC+ group: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.42-1.72; P = 0.65]).

Platelet transfusion is the only known treatment; however, it is the critical point to identify neonates who are really at risk of bleeding and benefit from platelet transfusion as it also has various potential harmful effects. Aims: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of neonatal thrombocytopenia and its relationship to intraventricular hemorrhage in the neonatal intensive care unit and to determine whether the use of platelet mass index-based criteria could reduce the rate of platelet transfusion. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: This study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. The medical records of neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit with platelet counts <150×109/L between January 2013 and July 2016 were analyzed. Results: During the study period, 2,667 patients were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 395 (14%) had thrombocytopenia during hospitalization. The rate of intraventricular hemorrhage was 7.3%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that although lower platelet counts were associated with a higher intraventricular hemorrhage rate, the effects of respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and patent ductus arteriosus were more prominent than the degree of thrombocytopenia. Thirty patients (7%) received platelet transfusion, and these patients showed a significantly higher mortality rate than their non-platelet transfusion counterparts (p<0.001). In addition, it was found that the use of platelet mass index-based criteria for platelet transfusion in our patients would reduce the rate of platelet transfusion by 9.5% (2/21). Conclusion: Neonatal thrombocytopenia is usually mild and often resolves without treatment. As platelet transfusion is associated with an increased mortality rate, its risks and benefits should be weighed carefully. The use of platelet mass index-based criteria may reduce platelet transfusion rates in the neonatal intensive care unit, but additional data from prospective studies are required.",2020/05//,Galenos Publishing House,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2397901663?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2397901663; 2004152643"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Intraventricular hemorrhage"", ""Neonatal intensive care unit"", ""Newborn"", ""Platelet mass index"", ""Platelet transfusion"", ""Thrombocytopenia"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""17:Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology"", ""7:Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""neonatal respiratory distress syndrome"", ""Article"", ""brain hemorrhage"", ""platelet parameters"", ""newborn"", ""risk factor"", ""mortality rate"", ""platelet count"", ""platelet mass index"", ""prevalence"", ""neonatal intensive care unit"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""neonatal thrombocytopenia -- epidemiology"", ""patent ductus arteriosus"", ""female"", ""neonatal thrombocytopenia -- therapy"", ""human"", ""male"", ""retrospective study"", ""sepsis""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2019.7.47"", ""issn"": ""21463123"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Pediatrics, Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University School of Medicine, Tokat, Turkey tubaserdar06@hotmail.com, Department of Biostatistics, Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University School of Medicine, Tokat, Turkey , Department of Medical Microbiology, Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University School of Medicine, Tokat, Turkey , Department of Pediatrics, Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University School of Medicine, Tokat, Turkey, Kasap, Tuba, Department of Pediatrics, Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University School of Medicine, Tokat, Turkey"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2020-05-06"", ""Date revised - 2020-05-06"", ""Number of references - 40"", ""Last updated - 2020-05-06""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Balkan+Medical+Journal&rft.atitle=Neonatal+thrombocytopenia+and+the+role+of+the+platelet+mass+index+in+platelet+transfusion+in+the+neonatal+intensive+care+unit&rft.au=Kasap%2C+Tuba&rft.aulast=Kasap&rft.aufirst=Tuba&rft.date=2020-05-01&rft.volume=37&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=150&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Balkan+Medical+Journal&rft.issn=21463123&rft_id=info:doi/10.4274%2Fbalkanmedj.galenos.2020.2019.7.47"", ""date"": ""May 2020""}"

RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to determine if high-acuity ICUs more effectively implement evidence-based processes of care that have been associated with improved clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed in adult ICU patients admitted to 322 ICUs in 199 hospitals in the Philips ICU telemedicine database between 2010 and 2015. The primary exposure was ICU acuity, defined as the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa score of all admitted patients in a calendar year, stratified into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine relations of ICU acuity with adherence to evidence-based VTE and stress ulcer prophylaxis, and with the avoidance of potentially harmful events. These events included hypoglycemia, sustained hyperglycemia, and liberal transfusion practices (defined as RBC transfusions prescribed for nonbleeding patients with preceding hemoglobin levels ≥ 7 g/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,058,510 ICU admissions, adherence to VTE and stress ulcer prophylaxis was high across acuity levels. In adjusted analyses, those admitted to low-acuity ICUs compared with the highest acuity ICUs were more likely to experience hypoglycemic events (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19), sustained hyperglycemia (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.10), and liberal transfusion practices (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.33-1.82).

An early approach to hemorrhagic shock by transfusion of blood products and damage-control resuscitation is essential to avoid lethal pentad and death. Objectives: To assess the quality of care in traumatic massive bleeding in a Level 1 Trauma Centre by analyzing two indicators: early activation of the massive transfusion protocol (MTP) and optimal transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC). Methods: A retrospective single-center cohort study was obtained from two prospective databases of University Hospital 12 De Octubre (Madrid): the Severe Traumatic Disease registry and the MTP database in a 6-year period of time (2013-2019). Study subjects: Traumatic patients who were admitted in the ICU and required transfusion of ten or more pRBC in the first 24 hours of admission (defining criteria of massive hemorrhage, MH). Variables of interest: - Early diagnostic sensitivity (S): Percentage of activation of MTP in patients with traumatic MH. TheTrauma-Associated-Severe-Haemorrhage (TASH) Score, the Injury-Severity-Score (ISS) and the percentage of FAST were retrospectively calculated in the false-negative (FN) subgroup. - Optimal transfusion of pRBC: According to scientific literature, three cohorts were described according to hemoglobin (Hb) at 24 hours of admission. Thepercentage of under-transfusion (UT) (Hb <8mg / dl) and over-transfusion (OT) (Hb> 11.9mg / dl) was studied. Data analysis: SPSS Statistics 24.0.0. Variable expression: mean and standard deviation. Results: Descriptive statistics First, a descriptive analysis of the MH cohort (n = 145) was performed. The mean age was 40.7 ± 17 years, with male predominance (76.6%). The mean ISS was 42.8 ± 16, highlighting a 72.4% prevalence of hemorrhagic shock coagulopathy and an overall mortality of 43.4%. Deaths were due to exsanguination (38%, n = 24), intracranial hypertension (36.5%, n = 23), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (12.7%, n = 8) and limitation of therapeutic effort (6.3%, n = 4). Regarding the mechanisms involved, the most relevant were precipitation (n = 45), sharp objects injury (n = 23), automobile accident (n = 21), motorcycle accident (n = 17) and pedestrian injury (n = 16). FAST was performed in 71.7% of the cases. Therapeutic arteriography was performed in 28.8% of the cases. 81.3% underwent damage control surgery. Diagnostic sensitivity MTP was activated in 135 out of the 145 patients with MH criteria (S = 93.1%). In FN (n = 10), the mean TASH score was 12.4 ± 3 and the mean ISS was 31.7 ± 12. 30% (n = 3) presented a TASH score <= 9 (MH pre-test probability <5%), all presenting with bleeding during damage control surgery requiring intraoperative transfusion > 6 pRBC. In the remaining cases (n = 7) the TASH score was > 13 (MH pre-test probability range 28-35%), with FAST being performed in 57% of cases (n = 4). Transfusion quality 68.7% of patients were in the optimal transfusion cohort, while 8.9% were in the UT cohort and 22.5% in the OT cohort. Mortality was respectively 25.6%, 50% and 24%, without statistically significant differences in subgroup analysis (p = 0.243). Conclusion: The diagnostic sensitivity was similar to that achieved by the MH prediction scores, considered the gold-standard. Nonetheless, FN analysis shows the need to optimize early identification. The transfusion target was suboptimal in one third of patients. Specific transfusion protocols need to be created for severe traumatic disease with intermediate pre-test probability of MH.",2020,Springer,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2484528195?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2484528195; 634009546"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""Embase"", ""diagnostic test accuracy study"", ""university hospital"", ""traffic accident"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""exsanguination"", ""hemorrhagic shock"", ""gold standard"", ""all cause mortality"", ""endogenous compound"", ""precipitation"", ""prevalence"", ""hospital management"", ""intracranial hypertension"", ""arteriography"", ""disease registry"", ""human"", ""scientific literature"", ""blood clotting disorder"", ""quality control"", ""injury scale"", ""probability"", ""human cell"", ""erythrocyte"", ""multiple organ failure"", ""controlled study"", ""prospective study"", ""conference abstract"", ""prediction"", ""pedestrian"", ""adult"", ""data analysis software"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-00354-8"", ""issn"": ""2197425X"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Medicina Intensiva, University Hospital 12 De Octubre, Madrid, Spain , Medicina Intensiva, University Hospital 12 De Octubre, Madrid, Spain, Munoz-Calahorro, R., Medicina Intensiva, University Hospital 12 De Octubre, Madrid, Spain"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 33rd European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Annual Congress,  ESICM 2020"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-01-31"", ""Date revised - 2021-02-01"", ""Last updated - 2021-02-02""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Intensive+Care+Medicine+Experimental&rft.atitle=Quality+assessment+for+in-hospital+management+of+massive+hemorrhage&rft.au=Munoz-Calahorro%2C+R.&rft.aulast=Munoz-Calahorro&rft.aufirst=R.&rft.date=2020-01-01&rft.volume=8&rft.issue=SUPPL+2&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Intensive+Care+Medicine+Experimental&rft.issn=2197425X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs40635-020-00354-8"", ""date"": ""2020""}"

In addition to the economic implications, there is emerging evidence that blood transfusion may increase both morbidity and mortality. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) may limit the need for blood products. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to determine if the method of blood collection (syringe or bag) during the ANH process impacted the platelet count and function. The secondary objectives included the need for perioperative blood transfusions during the procedure and in the intensive care unit. In addition, we assessed these outcomes' associations with ANH parameters including the method of collection, time of storage, and volume removed. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from 50 patients undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass over a 6-month period. Platelet count and function were measured for the ANH blood immediately after collection and again prior to transfusing to the patient at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Other data collected included ANH volume, length of storage, and the quantity of all blood products given throughout the perioperative period. RESULTS: No change in platelet count or function was noted regardless of the length of time or collection method for the ANH blood. Twenty-three patients received blood or blood products in the operating room or the intensive care unit, while 27 patients received no blood transfusion during their entire hospitalization. Higher ANH volume (ml·kg(-1) ) and longer storage time were associated with a greater need for intraoperative transfusions. CONCLUSION: Acute normovolemic hemodilution protects the platelets from the untoward effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and offers an important autologous blood product that improves hemostasis at the conclusion of surgery. Platelet count and function are preserved regardless of the method of collection or the length of storage. The volume of ANH removed appears to be an important determinant of blood product use and further understanding of the impact of this variable is a future direction of upcoming prospective research.",2017,France,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13014,"{""pmid"": 27734554, ""electronic_issn"": ""1460-9592"", ""linking_issn"": ""1155-5645"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9206575"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Observational Study""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adolescent"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Child"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Child, Preschool"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemodilution"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Infant"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Intraoperative Care"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Young Adult"", ""major"": false}], ""keywords"": [""autologous blood transfusion"", ""blood coagulation"", ""blood component transfusion"", ""hemostasis"", ""platelet function"", ""surgical blood loss""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2017 Jan"", ""dates"": {""accepted"": ""2016-09-05"", ""published"": ""2016-10-14"", ""electronic"": ""2016-10-13""}}"

The multivariable analyses showed GNA (versus GA) to be associated with a significantly decreased risk for thromboembolism (OR 0.74; CI 0.58-0.93) and cerebrovascular events (OR 0.67; CI 0.51-0.88), whereas the association was nonsignificant for wound infections, pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation. However, GNA use was significantly associated with increased risk for acute myocardial infarction (OR 2.74; CI 2.19-3.43), urinary tract infection (OR 1.35; CI 1.21-1.50), postoperative ileus (OR 1.17; CI 1.09-1.26), blood transfusion (OR 1.12; CI 1.01-1.24), and admission to intensive care unit (OR 1.32; CI 1.22-1.43).Conclusions We found no clear pattern of consistent favorable results for patients undergoing their open colectomy under GNA.

DESIGN: The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Model for Improvement provided a structure for this performance improvement project. Outcome evaluation was further supported by the Kirkpatrick model. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: Reports of rising maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States prompted action within a multisite health system. Maternity care teams were determined to proactively support excellence in practice through enhancements to continuing education. PARTICIPANTS: Maternity providers and nurses practicing within the organization completed the training. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: Online, assessment-driven learning modules for maternity emergencies were blended with existing instructor-led courses, simulation, and Team Strategies to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) training in early 2017. In addition, a postpartum hemorrhage safety bundle was implemented. Outcome measures included rates of hemorrhage, massive transfusion, and intensive care unit admission for women admitted for childbirth. Outcome measures were tracked using retrospective chart review with baseline period October 1, 2016, through March 31, 2017, and performance period April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2018. RESULTS: Improvements in perinatal outcomes were observed. The average rate of hemorrhage decreased by 3% (from 56.4/1,000 to 54.7/1,000). Median massive transfusion rates decreased by 35% (from 2.3/1,000 to 1.5/1,000). Similarly, the median rate of maternal intensive care unit admissions decreased by 77% (from 3.1/1,000 to 0.7/1,000). A downward shift was supported with zero intensive care unit admissions for 6 of the last 7 months (n = 4,422 pregnant women or women who experienced birth during the current admission). CONCLUSION: Excellence in the management of postpartum hemorrhage was supported through a multipronged approach that included the use of an online e-learning platform for maternity emergencies.",2020/12/01/,NLM (Medline),['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2459058760?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2459058760; 633342626"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""e-learning"", ""emergency"", ""maternal morbidity"", ""maternal mortality"", ""maternity"", ""postpartum hemorrhage"", ""MEDLINE"", ""blood transfusion"", ""patient safety"", ""education"", ""United States"", ""pregnancy"", ""maternal health service"", ""total quality management"", ""postpartum hemorrhage -- therapy"", ""procedures"", ""intensive care unit"", ""female"", ""health care personnel"", ""human"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nwh.2020.09.010"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"", ""Date created - 2021-06-17"", ""Date revised - 2021-06-17"", ""Last updated - 2021-06-17""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Nursing+for+women%27s+health&rft.atitle=Implementing+E-Learning+to+Enhance+the+Management+of+Postpartum+Hemorrhage&rft.au=Miner%2C+Julya&rft.aulast=Miner&rft.aufirst=Julya&rft.date=2020-12-01&rft.volume=24&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=421&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Nursing+for+women%27s+health&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.nwh.2020.09.010"", ""date"": ""2020 Dec 01""}"

To address this we conducted a retrospective review of platelet transfusion practice in patients developing severe thrombocytopenia over 3years in a single NICU. Out of 901 admissions, 53 (6%) developed severe thrombocytopenia. Twenty-seven neonates received a total of 63 platelet transfusions, the main triggers being: platelet count less than 30 × 109L-1 (all patients), or less than 50 × 109L-1 in those with previous haemorrhage or clinical instability. No major haemorrhage occurred during severe thrombocytopenia either in neonates in whom platelet transfusions were withheld (26/53) or in neonates given platelets who survived to discharge (22/27). Five preterm neonates given platelets died but all had overwhelming sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis and none died directly as a result of haemorrhage. Although the widely used liberal triggers for neonatal platelet transfusion highlighted in this review reflect available guidelines, and represent cautious ('safe') haemostatic practice, they are likely to result in unnecessary transfusion for a significant number of NICU patients. Improved practice requires definition of a safe lower limit for platelet count in stable neonates; effective platelet transfusion strategies for sick neonates; and improved therapies for conditions precipitating severe thrombocytopenia.",2002,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 9600 Garsington Road, OX4 2XG",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/693393173?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""693393173; 34184944"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Neonate"", ""Platelets"", ""Thrombocytopenia"", ""Transfusion"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""10:Obstetrics and Gynecology"", ""7:Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""major clinical study"", ""medical decision making"", ""newborn"", ""treatment indication"", ""treatment outcome"", ""article"", ""controlled study"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""newborn intensive care"", ""thrombocytopenia -- therapy"", ""disease severity"", ""human"", ""algorithm""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3148.2002.00343.x"", ""issn"": ""09587578"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Departments of Neonatal Medicine and Haematology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London, United Kingdom, Imperial College, Department of Paediatrics and Neonatal Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 OHS, United Kingdom neil.murray@ic.ac.uk, Departments of Neonatal Medicine and Haematology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London, United Kingdom , Departments of Neonatal Medicine and Haematology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London, United Kingdom, Imperial College, Department of Paediatrics and Neonatal Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 OHS, United Kingdom, Murray, N.A., Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 OHS, United Kingdom"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2002-03-12"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-18"", ""Number of references - 23"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - TRMDE""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Transfusion+Medicine&rft.atitle=Platelet+transfusion+in+the+management+of+severe+thrombocytopenia+in+neonatal+intensive+care+unit+patients&rft.au=Murray%2C+N.A.&rft.aulast=Murray&rft.aufirst=N.A.&rft.date=2002-01-01&rft.volume=12&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=35&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion+Medicine&rft.issn=09587578&rft_id=info:doi/10.1046%2Fj.1365-3148.2002.00343.x"", ""date"": ""2002""}"

We also investigated the influence of various factors on this increment, specifically, the storage time of transfused red cells and the age difference between transfused units where more than one unit was given. Data were taken from a subset of the Audit of Transfusion in Intensive Care in Scotland study (ATICS) [1]. Methods: Data from ten out of 26 general ICUs in Scotland were studied, including 1023 sequential admissions to ICU over 100 days. We collected information regarding pre-transfusion and post-transfusion Hb measured daily for all transfusion episodes not associated with clinically significant haemorrhage. Hb increment was calculated as the difference between the pre-transfusion Hb and the first available post-transfusion Hb. Data on storage time were collected separately for all transfused units. Ethics approval was not required as no changes to patient management occurred. Results: Data were complete for 224 patients who underwent 437 transfusion episodes. Mean increment in Hb was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-0.99) g.dl-1. Increments for the three categories of storage time were 0.83 (0.66-0.99), 0.96 (0.83-1.11) and 0.91 (0.82-0.99) g.dl-1 for storage times of 4-14, 15-24 and 25-35 days, respectively. No relationship was observed between storage time of transfused units of blood, or differences between storage time between transfused units when more than one unit was transfused, and increment in Hb. Discussion: Increment in Hb after transfusion of leuco-depleted red cells in critically ill non-bleeding patients is not affected by the storage time of transfused red cells or the difference in storage time between transfused red cell units where more than one unit is involved in the transfusion episode.

Despite prompt admission to the intensive care unit, microbe isolation was delayed due to the negativity of capsular antigens, and the patient required intubation, dialysis, and transfusion support for pancytopenia. Notably, PNH disease activity remained controlled and no additional anti-C5 doses were administered. Increasing awareness regarding septic risk in PNH patients on complement inhibitors despite vaccinations is pivotal. A warning about serotypes generally not pathogenetic and not covered by vaccination, such as non-capsulated forms, is emerging.",2023,Switzerland,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1269325,"{""pmid"": 37854608, ""electronic_issn"": ""1664-3224"", ""linking_issn"": ""1664-3224"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101560960"", ""publication_types"": [""Case Reports"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Review""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnosis"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal"", ""qualifier"": ""drug therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Complement Inactivating Agents"", ""qualifier"": ""therapeutic use"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Neisseria meningitidis"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemolysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pancytopenia"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Thrombosis"", ""qualifier"": ""drug therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Sepsis"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnosis"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Sepsis"", ""qualifier"": ""drug therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Sepsis"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": true}], ""keywords"": [""Neisseria meningitides"", ""eculizumab"", ""paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria"", ""proximal complement inhibitors"", ""ravulizumab""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2023"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2023-07-29"", ""accepted"": ""2023-08-30"", ""published"": ""2023-10-19"", ""electronic"": ""2023-10-02""}}"

The patients were separated into two groups: those who underwent a transplantation after open heart surgery were included in the Tp+ group, and those who did not in the Tp- group Between June 2008 and December 2012, 127 dialysis dependent patients awaiting kidney transplant and who underwent open heart surgery were separated into two groups. Those who underwent transplantation after open heart surgery were determined as Tp+ (n=33), and those who did not as Tp- (n=94). Both groups were compared with respect to preoperative paramaters including age, sex, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), hyperlipidemia (HL), obesity, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), left ventricle ejection fraction (EF), Euroscore; operative parameters including cross clamp time, perfusion time, number of grafts, use of internal mammary artery (IMA); postoperative parameters including revision, blood transfusion, ventilation time, use of inotropic agents, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, and follow up findings. Problems encountered during follow up were recorded. Predictors of mortality were determined and the survival was calculated. Among the preoperative parameters, when compared with the Tp- group, the Tp+ group had significantly lower values in mean age, presence of DM, obesity, PVD, and Euroscore levels, and higher EF values. Assessment of postoperative values showed that blood transfusion requirement and length of hospital stay were significantly lower in the Tp+ group compared to the Tp- group, whereas the length of follow up was significantly higher in the Tp+ group. The use of inotropic agents was significantly higher in the Tp- group. A logistic regression analysis was made to determine the factors affecting mortality. Revision (p=0.013), blood transfusion (p=0.017), ventilation time (p=0.019), and length of stay in the intensive care unit (p=0.009) were found as predictors of mortality. Survival rates at years 1, 2 and 3 were 86.1%, 81%, 77.5% in the Tp- group, and 96.0%, 96.3%, 90.4% in the Tp+ group. Median survival rate was 41.35±2.02 in the Tp- group, and 49.64±1.59 in the Tp+ group which was significantly higher compared to the Tp- group (p=0.048). Chronic renal failure is among the perioperative risk factors for patients undergoing open heart surgery.

The precise timing of anticoagulation initiation in critically ill patients with recent or active lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is not well defined. We set out to study the safety and efficacy of early heparin administration for DVT prophylaxis in these patients. Methods: A review of all patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of LGIB over a 13-year period was performed. A total of 60 patients received subcutaneous heparin along with mechanical prophylaxis, whereas 59 patients had intermittent pneumatic compression devices alone. Results: There was no difference in morbidity or mortality between the groups who received heparin and the nonheparin cohort. Neither of the groups developed a DVT or PE during the study period. Patients who received heparin had a median ICU LOS of 3 days, when compared with 2 days for patients who did not receive heparin (P < .0118). There was a significant association between units of blood received during the first 24 hours in the ICU and heparin usage (P < .0229). Those administered heparin received more units (median 3) than those who did not receive heparin (median 2). Conclusions: Administration of subcutaneous heparin ncreases the transfusion requirements and LOS in ICU patients with LGIB. After 24 hours, however, the blood transfusion requirements are equivalent. DVT prophylaxis in patients with a diagnosis of LGIB should be initiated after 24 hours of ICU admission. © The Author(s) 2012.",2012///Nov 2012 - Dec,"SAGE Publications Inc., 2455 Teller Road, CA 91320",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1151555379?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1151555379; 365950549"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Review"", ""keywords"": [""bleeding"", ""deep vein thrombosis"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""heparin"", ""pulmonary embolism"", ""37187-54-5"", ""8057-48-5"", ""8065-01-8"", ""9005-48-5"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""38:Adverse Reactions Titles"", ""15:Chest Diseases, Thoracic Surgery and Tuberculosis"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""48:Gastroenterology"", ""major clinical study"", ""transfusion"", ""deep vein thrombosis -- drug therapy"", ""heparin -- drug therapy -- deep vein thrombosis"", ""safety"", ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage -- side effect -- heparin"", ""review"", ""intensive care unit"", ""female"", ""heparin -- subcutaneous drug administration"", ""heparin induced thrombocytopenia -- side effect"", ""heparin -- adverse drug reaction -- heparin induced thrombocytopenia"", ""drug safety"", ""diagnosis"", ""heparin induced thrombocytopenia -- side effect -- heparin"", ""heparin -- adverse drug reaction -- gastrointestinal hemorrhage"", ""heparin -- adverse drug reaction"", ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage -- side effect"", ""intermittent pneumatic compression device"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""critically ill patient"", ""hospital admission"", ""heparin -- adverse drug reaction -- lower gastrointestinal bleeding"", ""United States"", ""cohort analysis"", ""anticoagulation"", ""lower gastrointestinal bleeding -- side effect -- heparin"", ""prophylaxis"", ""lower gastrointestinal bleeding -- side effect"", ""thrombosis prevention"", ""deep vein thrombosis -- drug therapy -- heparin"", ""lung embolism"", ""patient"", ""priority journal"", ""morbidity"", ""human"", ""health care system"", ""blood transfusion"", ""aged"", ""blood"", ""disease association"", ""bleeding -- complication"", ""controlled study"", ""mortality"", ""length of stay"", ""drug efficacy"", ""risk"", ""heparin -- drug therapy"", ""deep vein thrombosis -- prevention""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0885066611420339"", ""issn"": ""08850666"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Surgery and Critical Care, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, 270-05 76th Avenue, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, United States gdeutsch@nshs.edu, Department of Surgery, Division of Trauma and Critical Care, Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla, NY, United States , Department of Surgery and Critical Care, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, 270-05 76th Avenue, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, United States, Deutsch, G.B., Department of Surgery and Critical Care, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, 270-05 76th Avenue, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2012-11-13"", ""Date revised - 2013-04-12"", ""Number of references - 17"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - JICME""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Intensive+Care+Medicine&rft.atitle=Bleeding+risk+secondary+to+deep+vein+thrombosis+prophylaxis+in+patients+with+lower+gastrointestinal+bleeding&rft.au=Deutsch%2C+Gary+B.&rft.aulast=Deutsch&rft.aufirst=Gary&rft.date=2012-11-01&rft.volume=27&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=379&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Intensive+Care+Medicine&rft.issn=08850666&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F0885066611420339"", ""date"": ""Nov 2012 - Dec 2012""}"

The optimal hemoglobin transfusion threshold is uncertain in this patient population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact on neurological outcome of 2 different hemoglobin thresholds to guide red blood cell transfusions in patients with acute brain injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, phase 3, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, pragmatic, open-label randomized clinical trial conducted in 72 intensive care units across 22 countries. Eligible patients had traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intracerebral hemorrhage; hemoglobin values below 9 g/dL within the first 10 days after injury; and an expected intensive care unit stay of at least 72 hours. Enrollment occurred between September 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. The last day of follow-up was June 30, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Eight hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to undergo a liberal (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin <9 g/dL; n = 408) or a restrictive (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin <7 g/dL; n = 442) transfusion strategy over a 28-day period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was occurrence of an unfavorable neurological outcome, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score between 1 and 5, at 180 days following randomization. There were 14 prespecified serious adverse events, including occurrence of cerebral ischemia after randomization. RESULTS: Among 820 patients who completed the trial (mean age, 51 years; 376 [45.9%] women), 806 had available data on the primary outcome, 393 in the liberal strategy group and 413 in the restrictive strategy group. The liberal strategy group received a median of 2 (IQR, 1-3) units of blood, and the restrictive strategy group received a median of 0 (IQR, 0-1) units of blood, with an absolute mean difference of 1.0 unit (95% CI, 0.87-1.12 units). At 180 days after randomization, 246 patients (62.6%) in the liberal strategy group had an unfavorable neurological outcome compared with 300 patients (72.6%) in the restrictive strategy group (absolute difference, -10.0% [95% CI, -16.5% to -3.6%]; adjusted relative risk, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.94]; P = .002). The effect of the transfusion thresholds on neurological outcome at 180 days was consistent across prespecified subgroups. In the liberal strategy group, 35 (8.8%) of 397 patients had at least 1 cerebral ischemic event compared with 57 (13.5%) of 423 in the restrictive strategy group (relative risk, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44-0.97]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with acute brain injury and anemia randomized to a liberal transfusion strategy were less likely to have an unfavorable neurological outcome than those randomized to a restrictive strategy.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 17 pregnant women diagnosed with abnormal placentation in 2001⁻2018 in a single tertiary center. The patients were diagnosed by surgical finding, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These patients were divided into two groups: a prophylactic TAE group (11 patients) and a control group (6 patients). In the former group, prophylactic TAE of the bilateral uterine artery (UA) and/or internal iliac artery (IIA) was performed immediately after delivery of the infant. The placenta was removed in both groups. The primary outcomes were estimated blood loss (EBL), units of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion, operative time, whether hysterectomy was performed, whether the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and hospitalization days. The secondary outcome was maternal complications. RESULTS: Patients who received prophylactic TAE had significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss (990.9 ± 701.7 mL vs. 3448.3 ± 1767.4 mL, p = 0.018). Units of pRBC transfusion, operative time, hysterectomy, transfer to the ICU, and postoperative hospitalization days were not significantly different between the two groups. Thirteen patients (9 in the TAE group and 4 in the control group) received a blood transfusion during the operation. Three patients underwent a hysterectomy (1 in the TAE group and 2 in the control group). Five patients were transferred to the ICU (3 in the TAE group and 2 in the control group) for maternal complications or monitoring. In the prophylactic TAE group, 3 patients (27%) had a subsequent pregnancy within the next 5 years.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the Consortium on Safe Labor electronic database from 2002-2008; women with a prior cesarean birth, desiring TOLAC, and requiring induction of labor were included. Oxytocin and Foley bulb induction methods were compared to amniotomy alone. Prostaglandin use was also reviewed but, given the small numbers, was not the focus of this study. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed significantly greater incidence of hemorrhage >1,000 mL (p=0.0030) and transfusion (p=0.0076) with Foley bulb use.

Design: Consensus conference series of international, multidisciplinary experts in RBC transfusion management of critically ill children. Methods: The panel of 38 experts developed evidence-based and, when evidence was lacking, expert-based clinical recommendations and research priorities for RBC transfusions in critically ill children. The hematologic/oncologic subgroup included seven experts. Electronic searches were conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases jrom 1980 to May 2017. Agreement was obtained using the Research and Development/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method. Results: The hematologic/oncologic subgroup developed 14 recommendations (seven clinical, seven research); all achieved greater than 80% agreement. In patients with sickle cell disease, Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative recommends: 1) RBC transfusion to achieve a target hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL rather than hemoglobin of less than 30% prior to surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia and 2) exchange transfusion over simple (nonexchange) transfusion if the child's condition is deteriorating (based on clinical judgment), otherwise a simple, nonexchange RBC transfusion is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations on transfusion thresholds for patients with sickle cell disease prior to minor procedures, with acute stroke or with pulmonary hypertension. For patients with oncologic disease or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, a hemoglobin concentration of 7-8 g/dL is recommended. Due to lack of evidence, research is needed to clarify the appropriate transfusion thresholds in these patients.

We hypothesised that such transfusions of stored PRBCs directly into the arterial system may increase postoperative morbidity when compared to intravenous transfusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from 122 consecutive neonates who received transfusions of PRBCs in the course of corrective surgery for congenital heart defects were analysed. Group assignment was according to the timing of the first transfusion: during CPB (On-CPB) or after weaning from CPB (Post-CPB). Chi Square and rank sum tests were applied to compare clinical characteristics. Times until extubation and release from the intensive care unit were analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and by multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: Transfusion of PRBCs during CPB was associated with greater 48 hour blood loss (mean±standard deviation, 86±125 versus 32±16 mL/kg, p<0.001), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (214±268 versus 99±75 h, p<0.001) and longer stay on the intensive care unit (10.9±12.1 versus 5.3±3.5 days, p<0.001). However, the groups also differed in many characteristics, such as bodyweight, complexity of surgery or preoperative haemoglobin concentration, which may also affect outcome. Yet, multivariate analyses confirmed an independent association of transfusion On-CPB with an adverse clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the transfusion of PRBCs during CPB may increase postoperative morbidity. However, due to the limitations of this retrospective analysis, further studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship between the timing of the transfusion and the clinical outcome and to elucidate putative mechanisms of such an association.",2014,England,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659113517922,"{""pmid"": 24395681, ""electronic_issn"": ""1477-111X"", ""linking_issn"": ""0267-6591"", ""nlm_status"": ""Publisher"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""8700166"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""blood transfusion"", ""cardiopulmonary bypass"", ""clinical outcome"", ""congenital heart defects"", ""paediatric cardiac surgery""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2014 Jul"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2014-01-08"", ""electronic"": ""2014-01-06""}}"

METHODS: In this multicenter, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who had septic shock and a hemoglobin concentration of 9 g per deciliter or less to receive 1 unit of leukoreduced red cells when the hemoglobin level was 7 g per deciliter or less (lower threshold) or when the level was 9 g per deciliter or less (higher threshold) during the ICU stay. The primary outcome measure was death by 90 days after randomization. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 998 of 1005 patients (99.3%) who underwent randomization. The two intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. In the ICU, the lower-threshold group received a median of 1 unit of blood (interquartile range, 0 to 3) and the higher-threshold group received a median of 4 units (interquartile range, 2 to 7). At 90 days after randomization, 216 of 502 patients (43.0%) assigned to the lower-threshold group, as compared with 223 of 496 (45.0%) assigned to the higher-threshold group, had died (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.09; P=0.44). The results were similar in analyses adjusted for risk factors at baseline and in analyses of the per-protocol populations. The numbers of patients who had ischemic events, who had severe adverse reactions, and who required life support were similar in the two intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with septic shock, mortality at 90 days and rates of ischemic events and use of life support were similar among those assigned to blood transfusion at a higher hemoglobin threshold and those assigned to blood transfusion at a lower threshold; the latter group received fewer transfusions.

Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used in NICUs for evaluating tissue oxygenation with increasing frequency. This study aimed to demonstrate the affect of pRBC transfusion on cerebral, splanchnic, renal tissue oxygenation index (TOI) measured by NIRS. Methods Preterm infants who were transfused with pRBC in NICU were included. Cerebral, renal, splanchnic TOI values and splanchnic/cerebral, splanchnic/renal, renal/cerebral TOI ratios and vital signs of infants were evaluated before and 24 hours after transfusion. NIRS recordings were obtained for 30 minute periods by Sensmart Nonin device. Results Twenty preterm infants (75% female, 25% male) were included in the study. Mean gestational age and birth weight were 29.4±2.6 weeks and 1189±371 grams, respectively. Corrected age during transfusion was 32±4weeks. Mean Hb level before and after transfusion was 7.9±1.3 and 10.9±1.7g, respectively. Cerebral, renal TOI values and splanchnic/renal, renal/cerebral TOI ratios did not change significantly after transfusion. However splanchnic TOI (64.6 ±11.6 vs 69.3±12.7) and splanchnic/cerebral TOI ratio (84.7±15 vs 92±14) increased slightly although difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions In this study tissue oxygenation index measured by NIRS did not change significantly by transfusion, but splanchnic TOI increased mildly. Oxygenation increasemay demonstrate rising splanchnic blood flow which maybe the body site mostly affected from low Hb. This situation may trigger oxidative damage and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Reports of TRALI secondary to other blood products are rare. We present a caseof post-mortem histopathological findings consistent with TRALI in a 33-year-old female who received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for Guillan-Barre Syndrome.Case presentation A 33-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and morbid obesity presented with lower extremity weakness. She was subsequently diagnosed and admitted for Guillan-Barre Syndrome. She received five days of IVIG and was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation. Despite therapy, the patient had persistent lower extremity weakness. She had no evidence of respiratory involvement. Given her lack of improvement, a second course of IVIG. Infusion was initiated overnight on sixth day rehab admission. Within six hours of initiation, the patient developed significant respiratory distress and hypoxia. Arterial blood gas demonstrated no findings of CO2 retention. Chest X-ray showed new bilateral infiltrates. The patient was given a trial of intravenous furosemide for concerns for pulmonary edema and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities. The patient did not respond to diuresis and succumbed to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient ultimately expired following a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest secondary to refractory hypoxemia after one day of mechanicalventilation. A postmortem examination revealed histopathological findings of hyaline membranes and diffuse alveolar damage consistent with TRALI.Discussion A retrospective review of the literature conducted by Baudel et al identified only seventeen cases of IVIG related TRALI from 1990 to 2019. (1) The pathophysiologic mechanism by which TRALI occurs isthought to be donor anti-leukocytic antibodies (usually anti-HLA class I or II) activating neutrophils inthe pulmonary vasculature. The mechanism by which IVIG induces TRALI however, is suggested to bean antibody independent mechanism, though is unfortunately poorly understood.Conclusion TRALI is a rare and life-threatening condition that should be considered as a complication when administering IVIG.",2023/05//,American Thoracic Society,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2830427124?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2830427124; 641644102"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""furosemide"", ""54-31-9"", ""hyalin"", ""8037-23-8"", ""immunoglobulin"", ""9007-83-4"", ""Embase"", ""hypoxemia"", ""complication"", ""human immunoglobulin"", ""medical history"", ""hypercapnia"", ""transfusion related acute lung injury"", ""histopathology"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""neutrophil"", ""endogenous compound"", ""weakness"", ""rehabilitation"", ""thorax radiography"", ""arterial gas"", ""endotracheal intubation"", ""heart arrest"", ""female"", ""hospital patient"", ""human"", ""electric activity"", ""clinical trial"", ""morbid obesity"", ""hypoxia"", ""lung edema"", ""drug therapy"", ""artificial ventilation"", ""Guillain Barre syndrome"", ""diffuse alveolar damage"", ""ground glass opacity"", ""human cell"", ""intravenous drug administration"", ""medical intensive care unit"", ""systematic review"", ""lung blood vessel"", ""HLA antibody"", ""lower limb"", ""leukocyte"", ""conference abstract"", ""diuresis"", ""adult"", ""autopsy"", ""hypertension"", ""respiratory distress"", ""retrospective study"", ""x-ray computed tomography""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2023.B36"", ""issn"": ""15354970"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Internal Medicine, Jefferson Abington Hospital, Abington, PA, United States , Internal Medicine, Abington Hospital Jefferson Health, Abington, PA, United States , Jefferson Abington Hospital, Abington, PA, United States , Abington Memorial Hospital - Jefferson Health, Abington, PA, United States , Abington Pulm and CC Assoc, Abington, PA, United States , Internal Medicine, Jefferson Abington Hospital, Abington, PA, United States, Mehreen, R., Internal Medicine, Jefferson Abington Hospital, Abington, PA, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - American Thoracic Society International Conference, ATS 2023"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2023-06-28"", ""Date revised - 2023-06-28"", ""Last updated - 2023-06-29""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=American+Journal+of+Respiratory+and+Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.atitle=Transfusion+Related+Acute+Lung+Injury+%28TRALI%29+Induced+By+Intravenous+Immunoglobulins+%28IVIG%29&rft.au=Mehreen%2C+R.&rft.aulast=Mehreen&rft.aufirst=R.&rft.date=2023-05-01&rft.volume=207&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+Journal+of+Respiratory+and+Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.issn=15354970&rft_id=info:doi/10.1164%2Fajrccm-conference.2023.B36"", ""date"": ""May 2023""}"

Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Seventeen Italian NICUs. Patients and methods: Over a period of 12 months, for all neonates that received FFP we recorded specific characteristics, pretransfusion and post-transfusion laboratory test of haemostasis, and details of all haemorrhagic events. Results: Among 3506 NICU admissions, 290 (8.2%) received one or more FFP transfusions during their hospital stay. Of these, 37% received FFP because of active bleeding and 63% received FFP prophylactically with the intention of preventing haemorrhage. A total of 609 FFP transfusions were administered (mean 2.1/transfused patient - range 1-25). Using previously agreed upon criteria, we judged that 60% of the 609 FFP transfusions were not compliant with guideline recommendations. By logistic regression, abnormalities in the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and platelet count were not independently associated with bleeding episodes.

Cell salvaging is well established in the blood management of cardiac patients, but there remain some concerns about its effects on perioperative bleeding and transfusion variables. This randomized controlled study investigated the potential effects of the centrifuged end‐product on bleeding, transfusion rates, and other transfusion‐related variables in adult cardiac surgery patients submitted to extracorporeal circulation. Materials and Methods. Patients were randomly chosen to receive (cell‐salvage group, 99 patients) or not to receive (control group, 110 patients) the centrifuged product of a cell salvage apparatus. Bleeding and transfusion rates according to the universal definition of perioperative bleeding (UDPB) classification, postoperative hemoglobin, coagulation, and oxygenation indices were recorded and compared between the groups. Results. Both groups had almost identical bleeding and transfusion rates (median value: 2 units of red blood cells (RBC) and no units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) for both groups, p>0.05). Patients in the cell‐salvage group presented slightly higher hemoglobin concentrations (10.6 ± 1.1 vs. 10.1 ± 1.7 g/dL, p<0.05, respectively) and a tendency towards better oxygenation indices (PaO2/FiO2: 241 ± 94 vs. 207 ± 84, p=0.013) in the postoperative period albeit with a tendency for prolongation of prothrombin time (INR: 1.31 ± 0.18 vs. 1.26 ± 0.12, p=0.008).

53ee97c0-9a47-4fa4-b3dd-d05a08f09b78,Survival and associated predictor in the critically ill patient after transfusion therapy,"['Marqués Álvarez, L.', 'Rodríguez García, R.', 'Escudero Augusto, D.', 'Victoreo Fernández, R.', 'Martínez Revuelta, E.', 'Yano Escudero, R.', 'De Cima Iglesias, S.', 'Espina Angulo, M.J.', 'Palomo Antequera, C.']",Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,5,2,,"INTRODUCTION. Blood transfusions are an usually practice at the ICU. There is an increasing evidence of potential harm and sometimes worsen patient outcomes so, nowadays, we suggest that blood and component transfusions carry significant though poorly quantified risks. It has been estimated that greater than 40% of patients receive one or more red blood cell transfusions (RBC) while in the ICU. OBJECTIVES. The aim of our study was to determinate short term survival and associated predictors obtained on admission and during staying at ICU. METHODS. We made a retrospective and observational study of patients admitted to the ICU during six months and who have received at least one blood component. Patients admitted with cardiac diseases were excluded. On admission, we recorded clinical and laboratory parameters. Survival of patients at the end of the study was investigated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated and compared by Long Rank test. Factors associated with survival were obtained using multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS. 137 patients were identified. The mean age was 61.6 ± 15 years and 65% were men. On admission the mean value of APACHE II was 22 ± 7. 43% came from the emergency department, 37% from the hospital ward and 20% from another hospital. 61% required invasive ventilation, 48% received vassopresors and 19% CVVHDF. Among of 1144 units were transfused, 602 (53%) were red blood cells, 305 (27%) platelets, 234 (20%) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 3 (<1%) cryoprecipitates. Most patients received RBC (79%). The average pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration was 7.9 ± 2 g/dl and the ratio RBC/patient was 5.6 ± 6.2. The common indication for transfusion was low hemoglobin (39% had Hb < 7 g/dl, 42% between 7-9 g/dl). Overall, 67 (49%) and 31 (23%) of the patients were transfused platelets and FFP, respectively. The indications for transfusion were hemorrhage, low platelet counts, prolonged prothrombin time or to provide cover for invasive interventions. Most platelet transfusions were given at values in the order of > 50.000/ mcl (53.7%). Total survival achieved 63.5%. The accumulated survival decreased below 50% at the month. Immunosuppression, APACHE II, ventilation, CVVHDF, vasopressors, number of RBC transfused, hemoglobin and platelet pretransfusion values were statistically significant variables related to survival analysis (p < 0.05). The number of transfused RBCs was the only independent predictor of survival (p = 0.035). The average stay in ICU and in the hospital ward was of 14 ± 15 and 21 ± 28 days respectively. ICU mortality was 29.2%. Most patients died within the first week. CONCLUSIONS. Transfusion practice in ICU is consistent with the clinical practice guidelines.

The authors investigated the relation of blood transfusion to mortality in European intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: The Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients study was a multicenter, observational study that included all adult patients admitted to 198 European ICUs between May 1 and May 15, 2002 and followed them until death, until hospital discharge, or for 60 days. Patients were classified depending on whether they had received a blood transfusion at any time during their ICU stay. RESULTS: Of 3,147 patients, 1,040 (33.0%) received a blood transfusion. These patients were older (mean age, 62 vs. 60 yr; P = 0.035) and were more likely to have liver cirrhosis or hematologic cancer, to be a surgical admission, and to have sepsis. They had a longer duration of ICU stay (5.9 vs. 2.5 days; P < 0.001) and a higher ICU mortality rate (23.0 vs. 16.3%; P < 0.001) but were also more severely ill on admission (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 40.2 vs. 34.7; P < 0.001; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 6.5 vs. 4.5; P < 0.001). There was a direct relation between the number of blood transfusions and the mortality rate, but in multivariate analysis, blood transfusion was not significantly associated with a worse mortality rate. Moreover, in 821 pairs matched according to a propensity score, there was a higher 30-day survival rate in the transfusion group than in the other patients (P = 0.004).

Specific patient- and transfusion-related risk factors are largely unknown. In this study, risk factors for developing a bacterial infection after transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) or platelets were determined in a cohort of transfused critically ill trauma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a mixed medical-surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a level-1 university trauma centre, in trauma patients who received a RBC or platelet transfusion. Patients who developed a bacterial infection after transfusion were compared to transfused controls who did not develop such an infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for infection. RESULTS: Of the 7,118 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, 196 trauma patients met the inclusion criteria. An infection developed in 56 patients (29%). Infection occurred irrespective of the administration of antibiotics as part of selective digestive tract decontamination, surgery status or Injury Severity Score. Transfusion of RBC stored for more than 14 days was associated with infection in trauma patients (odds ratio 1.038, [95% CI: 1.01-1.07], p=0.036). Neither the amount of RBC nor that of platelets was associated with onset of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion of RBC stored for more then 14 days is a risk factor for onset of bacterial infection after trauma, irrespective of the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Transfusion of platelets was not a risk factor.

DESIGN: Meta‐analysis of relevant studies sourced from the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (2007 issue 4), EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases (1966 to February 1, 2008) without language restriction. SETTING & POPULATION: Adult patients undergoing major surgery without the use of radiocontrast. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Randomized controlled studies comparing N‐acetylcysteine with a placebo perioperatively. DATA ANALYSIS: Categorical variables are reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous variables are reported as weighted‐mean‐difference (WMD) with 95% CI. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effects of N‐acetylcysteine on mortality and acute renal failure requiring dialysis were the main outcomes of interest. Additional outcome measures included an incremental increase in serum creatinine concentration greater than 25% above baseline, surgical reexploration for bleeding, amount of allogeneic blood transfusion, and length of intensive care unit stay. RESULTS: 10 studies involving a total of 1,193 adult patients undergoing major surgery were considered. N‐Acetylcysteine use was not associated with a decrease in mortality (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.92), acute renal failure requiring dialysis (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37), incremental increase in serum creatinine concentration greater than 25% above baseline (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.11), or length of intensive care unit stay (WMD in days, 0.46; 95% CI, ‐0.43 to 1.36). N‐acetylcysteine did not appear to increase the risk of surgical reexploration for bleeding (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.57 to 2.38) or amount of allogeneic blood transfusion required (WMD in units, 0.31; 95% CI, ‐0.21 to 0.84).

Splanchnic hypoperfusion associated with packed red blood cell transfusion (PRBCT) and feeding has been implicated, but studies of splanchnic tissue oxygenation with respect to feeding plus PRBCT are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the oxygen utilization efficiency of preterm gut and brain challenged with bolus feeding during anemia and after transfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study conducted from September 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016, at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit included 25 hemodynamically stable infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks, birth weight less than 1500 g, and postmenstrual age younger than 37 weeks. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018. EXPOSURES: Infants received PRBCT (15 mL/kg for 4 hours) and at least 120 mL/kg daily of second hourly bolus feedings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Splanchnic fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEs) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) measures were made during 75-minute feeding cycles that comprised a 15-minute preprandial feeding phase (FP0) and 4 contiguous 15-minute postprandial feeding phases (FP1, FP2, FP3, and FP4; each 15 minutes long). The intraindividual comparisons of feeding-related changes were evaluated during the pretransfusion epoch (TE0: 4 hours before onset of transfusion) and 3 TEs after transfusion (TE1: first 8 hours after PRBCT completion; TE2: 9-16 hours after PRBCT completion; and TE3: 17-24 hours after PRBCT completion). RESULTS: Of 25 enrolled infants (13 [52%] female; median birth weight, 949 g [interquartile range {IQR}, 780-1100 g]; median gestational age, 26.9 weeks [IQR, 25.9-28.6 weeks]; median enrollment weight, 1670 g [IQR, 1357-1937 g]; and median postmenstrual age, 34 weeks [IQR, 32.9-35 weeks]), 1 infant was excluded because of corrupted near-infrared spectroscopy data. No overall association was found between FTOEs and FPs in a multivariable repeated-measures model that accounted for transfusion epochs (primary analysis approach) (FP0: mean estimate, 11.64; 95% CI, 9.55-13.73; FP1: mean estimate, 12.02; 95% CI, 9.92-14.11; FP2: mean estimate, 12.77; 95% CI, 10.68-14.87; FP3: mean estimate, 12.54; 95% CI, 10.45-14.64; FP4: mean estimate, 12.98; 95% CI, 10.89-15.08; P = .16 for the FP association). However exploratory analyses of postprandial changes in FTOEs undertaken for each transfusion epoch separately found evidence of increased postprandial FTOEs during TE1 (mean [SD] FTOEs, 10.55 [5.5] at FP0 vs 13.21 [5.96] at FP4, P = .046). The primary and exploratory analyses found no association between FTOEc and feeding phases, suggesting that cerebral oxygenation may be protected. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that enteral feeding may be associated with gut ischemia and potentially transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis. The postprandial changes in FTOEs appear to warrant further investigation in larger randomized studies.",2020,United States,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0149,"{""pmid"": 32108891, ""electronic_issn"": ""2574-3805"", ""linking_issn"": ""2574-3805"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101729235"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Anemia, Neonatal"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Enteral Nutrition"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Gestational Age"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Infant, Newborn"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Infant, Premature"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Infant, Very Low Birth Weight"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Oxygen"", ""qualifier"": ""metabolism"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Splanchnic Circulation"", ""qualifier"": ""physiology"", ""major"": true}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2020 Feb 5"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2020-02-29"", ""electronic"": ""2020-02-05""}}"

METHODS. In 30 adult patients with major trauma (ISS Score > 12), mean age of 55 years old (range 17-65), we analysed the Renal Doppler resistance index at admittance (within first hour from trauma) and we related Renal Doppler resistance index to arterial blood gas analysis (Hb, BE, lattati, CO2, pO2, ph) and outcome in the first 24 h (mortality, ICU admittance, eritrociatis transfusion). RESULTS: Patients with higher Renal Doppler Resistance Index at admittance (0.80 vs 0.64), presented hypovolemic shock (Mean Arterial Pressure < 60 mmHg for >30 min) within the next 24 h, needed more red blood cells transfusion (3 ± 3 Units vs 0 ± 1) and needed more ICU admittance (75 vs 5%). Renal Doppler Resistance Index was significantly related (p < 0.05) with Base Excess Deficit (8 ± 5vs 3 ± 2) and pCO2 (32 vs 38 mmHg).

Quantitative blood loss (QBL) aims to overcome inaccuracies associated with visual EBL. We compared the accuracy of obstetric EBL for prediction of postpartum hemoglobin (Hgb) changes before and after adoption of a colorimetric QBL system (Triton, Gauss Surgical). Study Design: Retrospective cohort of deliveries before (“pre-QBL,” 8/2015-2/2017) and after (“post-QBL,” 8/2018- 3/2018) QBL adoption. Deliveries (3/2017-7/2017) were excluded during transition to QBL. Women met inclusion if they delivered at ≥20wks. All pre-QBL deliveries had physician EBL values. In the post-QBL phase, QBL was recorded as a separate value from physician EBL, but physicians were not blinded to the QBL value. The primary outcome was the difference between actual change in Hgb (predelivery Hgb - Hgb 24hrs after delivery) and predicted change in Hgb (predelivery Hgb - predicted Hgb 24hrs after delivery). Differences closer to 0 were more accurate with - and + values reflecting over- and underestimation, respectively. Predicted Hgb values were calculated using EBL, maternal blood volume and predelivery Hgb. Analyses were stratified by mode of delivery and PPH (EBL>1000mL). A secondary analysis compared predicted change in Hgb using pre-intervention EBL values and post -intervention QBL values. Secondary outcomes included composite maternal morbidity (blood transfusion >2 units, embolization, hysterectomy, ICU, exploratory laparotomy, DIC, intubation, kidney injury, and death) and time from PPH to transfusion of blood products. Mean differences between pre-QBL and post-QBL were evaluated with two- sample Student t-tests. Results: There were 9,101 deliveries; 2,753 were post-QBL. Physician EBL was less accurate for prediction of change in Hgb after implementation of QBL in deliveries without PPH (Table 1). QBL values were more accurate than pre- intervention EBL values for prediction of Hgb change among cases of PPH (Table 2). Although less accurate, EBL in cases of PPH was an overestimate of change in Hgb. There was no difference in maternal composite morbidity (9.8 vs 12.3%; p=0.28) or median time to transfusion (17.0 vs 6.3 hours, p=0.51) between pre- and post-QBL. Conclusion: QBL estimates were more accurate in the setting of PPH; however, QBL adoption did not improve morbidity or time to transfusion in our tertiary care center. Analysis of the utility of QBL in other settings is warranted.

OBJECTIVES: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute chest syndrome transfused to hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL; and to compare hospital LOS in acute chest syndrome patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all acute chest syndrome patients treated in the medical ICU at 2 tertiary care hospitals between January 2011 and August 2016 (n = 82). We compared median hospital LOS in patients transfused to hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL by the time of ICU transfer to the medical floor versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL as well as patients who received exchange transfusion versus no exchange transfusion using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We modeled the association between hospital LOS and hemoglobin at ICU transfer to the medical floor using multivariable log-linear regression. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was about half as long for patients transfused to hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL versus hemoglobin < 8 g/dL (8.0 versus 16.5 days, P = 0.008). There was no difference in LOS for patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. On average, a 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin was associated with a 19.5% decrease (95% CI 10.8-28.2%) in LOS, controlling for possible confounding factors.

However, the optimal hemoglobin (Hb) threshold for transfusion is not clearly established. This study aims to define the optimal threshold for transfusion in critically ill TBI patients. Methods: The MIMIC-III database was queried for all adult (age ≥18 years) isolated-TBI patients (extracranial-Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] < 3) admitted to the ICU who received blood transfusion. Outcomes measures were transfusion-reaction (transfusion-associated-acute-lung-injury, transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload) and mortality. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the Hb transfusion threshold that best predicts survival. Regression analysis was performed. Results: A total of 707 patients were abstracted. Mean age was 59 ± 10 years, 58% were men, and median head-AIS was 3 (range 3-4). The AUROC curve analysis revealed that a Hb of 8.65 g/dL best predicts survival, while Hb of 10.35 g/dL best predicts mortality (Figure). The sample was divided into 3 subsets—low transfusion threshold: Hb <8 g/dL (4.4%), intermediate: Hb 8 g/dL to10 g/dL (33.8%), and high: Hb >10 g/dL (63.8%). Packed red blood cell units transfused per group were 5 (3-6), 3 (2-5), and 2 (1-4); p < 0.001, respectively. Transfusion reactions were highest in the low threshold group (low: 4%; intermediate: 2%; high: 0.5%, p = 0.04). Patients in the intermediate group had the lowest rate of mortality (intermediate: 37.7%; low: 61.3%; high: 48.3%, p = 0.006). On regression analysis, the intermediate Hb threshold was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.79[0.54-0.83]), while a low (OR 1.93[1.82-1.97) and high threshold (OR 1.21[1.13-1.28]) were associated with higher mortality.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare HCR with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a range of clinical outcomes and hospital costs. Methods: To identify potential studies, systematic searches were carried out in various databases. The key search terms included ""hybrid revascularization"" AND ""coronary artery bypass grafting"" OR ""HCR"" OR ""CABG."" This was followed by a meta-analysis investigating the need for blood transfusion, hospital costs, ventilation time, hospital stay, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, mortality, postoperative atrial fibrillation, renal failure, operation duration, and ICU stay. Results: The requirement for blood transfusion was significantly lower for HCR: odds ratio 0.38 (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.31-0.46, P<.00001) as was the hospital stay: mean difference (MD) 1.48 days (95% CI, 2.61 to 0.36, P=0.01) and the ventilation time: MD 8.99 hours (95% CI, 15.85 to 2.13, P=.01). On the contrary, hospital costs were more expensive for HCR: MD $3970 (95% CI, 2570-5370, P<.00001). All other comparisons were insignificant.

edf823b3-8c86-4b81-bb01-febb00cf5858,Acute transfusion-related abdominal injury in trauma patients: A case report,"['Michel, P.', 'Wähnert, D.', 'Freistühler, M.', 'Laukoetter, M.G.', 'Rehberg, S.', 'Raschke, M.J.', 'Garcia, P.']",Journal of Medical Case Reports,10,1,,"Background: Secondary abdominal compartment syndrome is well known as a life-threatening complication in critically ill patients in an intensive care unit. Massive crystalloid fluid resuscitation has been identified as the most important risk factor. The time interval from hospital admittance to the development of manifest abdominal compartment syndrome is usually greater than 24 hours. In the absence of any direct abdominal trauma, we observed a rapidly evolving secondary abdominal compartment syndrome shortly after hospital admittance associated with massive transfusion of blood products and only moderate crystalloid resuscitation. Case presentation: We report the case of an acute secondary abdominal compartment syndrome developing within 3 to 4 hours in a 74-year-old polytraumatized white woman. Although multiple fractures of her extremities and a B-type pelvic ring fracture were diagnosed by a full body computed tomography scan, no intra-abdominal injury could be detected. Hemorrhagic shock with a drop in her hemoglobin level to 5.7 g/dl was treated by massive transfusion of blood products and high doses of catecholamines. Shortly afterwards, her pulmonary gas exchange progressively deteriorated and mechanical ventilation became almost impossible with peak airway pressures of up to 60 cmH2O. Her abdomen appeared rigid and tense accompanied by a progressive hemodynamic decompensation necessitating mechanic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although preoperative computed tomography scans showed no signs of intra-abdominal fluid, a decompressive laparotomy under cardiopulmonary resuscitation conditions was performed and 2 liters of ascites-like fluid disgorged. Her hemodynamics and pulmonary ventilation improved immediately. Conclusions: This case report describes for the first time acute secondary abdominal compartment syndrome in a trauma patient, evolving in a very short time period.

51f2aab5-02ef-4a95-86bc-3a70c4c21977,'Innumerable' Blast Cells in the Bronchoalveolar Lavage (Pulmonary Leukostasis): A Case Report,"['Raymond, L.', 'Raymond, C.', 'Couillard, S.', 'Temmar, R.']",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,207,1,,"INTRODUCTION: People with acute myeloid leukemia and pulmonary infiltrates are at high-risk of mortality. The differential diagnosis is excessively broad and includes opportunistic infections, cardiovascular complications, adverse effects of treatment and medication and oncology specific diagnosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old woman was sent to an emergency room for fever after receiving a blood transfusion. Previous history was remarkable for acute myeloid leukemia (cytogenetics: t(15;17) FLT3-ITD (+)), treated by high-dose cytarabine and anthracycline (7+3 protocol) 2 months prior. She received blood transfusion for pancytopenia.Upon admission, patient had mild dyspnea, but afebrile. She was moderately hypoxemic with 4L of O2 by nasal canula. She denied infectious symptoms, cough, or sputum. Blood work was ordered and showed a markedly elevated white blood cell count (176×109/L), of which 97% were blasts, and thrombocytopenia (13×109/L) The chest X-Ray was normal. A computed tomography was ordered the next day, revealing central alveolar consolidations surrounded by ground glass opacities and septal thickening (Fig-AB). Upon the initial findings, the working differential diagnosis favored atypical pneumonia (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii), acute pulmonary oedema, transfusion-related lung injury, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.Initial treatment included broad-spectrum antibiotics (with Pneumocystis coverage) and diuretics. Specific blood work including Cytomegalovirus PCR, galactomannan and blood cultures was negative; NT-proBNP were raised (4235 pg/ml). A bronchoscopy was performed in the intensive care unit, including broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) with Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR, Legionella sp. culture, Nocardia and galactomannan. The BAL differential cell count was impossible due to 'innumerable blast cells'. (Fig-C). Diuretics were ineffective and resulted in acute kidney injury. Further cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea and rescue therapy were offered. The patient remained unwell; she moved towards palliative care and deceased peacefully, 1 month after her admission. DISCUSSION: People presenting with acute myeloid leukemia and central pulmonary opacities, as observed in this patient, elicit a broad differential diagnosis. We favored atypical/opportunistic pneumonia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, transfusion-related lung injury, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, but had not suspected pulmonary leukostasis. Our report describes a florid case of pulmonary leukostasis, with 'innumerable' blast cell infiltrates shown in the BAL. The presumed physiopathology is that of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and/or direct vascular injury. Confirmation of blast cell infiltrates on BAL is rare but can guide further management with further cytoreductive therapy. Unfortunately, it carries a very unfavorable prognosis when identified too late.

562b3fb3-73c3-4dda-b501-7dd46e21be19,Storage time of transfused packed red blood cells and mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective study,"['Ben Dabebiss, Rafla', 'Mahmoud, Jihène', 'Chouchène, Salma', 'Zouari, Hajer', 'Bouatay, Amina', 'Hmouda, Houssem']",Annals of Intensive Care,12,,,"Rationale: Anemia is frequently diagnosed in intensive care. It may be present at admission or may develop during ICU stay due to blood loss secondary to frequent blood sampling in most of the cases. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions may be lifesaving in some circumstances. However, several studies have reported increased morbidity and mortality in transfused patients due to “storage lesions” of older blood. This study focuses on outcome of transfused patients according to storage time of RBCs, and compares transfusion yield between older and newer blood. Patients and methods/Materials and methods: This is a retrospective descriptive and analytical study of patients admitted between January 2014 and January 2021, who received RBC transfusion in the ICU. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, as well as the number of transfused packed RBCs, storage time (age) of each unit, and estimation of blood spoliation secondary to blood sampling during ICU stay. Results: During the study period, 80 patients were concerned by 150 transfusion episodes, including 236 packed RBCs. The mean age of patients was 57.1 ± 18.5 years. All patients had co-morbid conditions. Acute respiratory failure was the most frequent diagnosis present in 65% of cases at admission. The APACHE II score was 20.4 ± 9.4, and SAPS II score was 48.5 ± 21.1. The mean hemoglobin level at admission was 9 ± 2.7 g/dl. The mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin level was 6.9 ± 1.1 g/ dl. The mean time to first ICU transfusion was 7.7 ± 8.7 days. Age of RBCs was 1 to 5 days in 21 transfusion episodes (14%), 6 to 10 days in 46 episodes (30.7%), 11 to 19 days in 59 episodes (39.3%), and ≥ 20 days in 24 transfusion episodes (16%). Mortality rate among transfused patients was 47.5%, and was related to severity of illness. Patients who received older blood did not have a significantly higher mortality (p = 0.839), however the increment in hemoglobin per episode was significantly higher with newer blood (P = 0.001). The mean value of blood spoliation was 426.7 ± 387.9 ml, and the number of transfusion episodes increased with blood spoliation and length of ICU stay. There was no statistically significant link between blood spoliation and mortality. Conclusion: Newer transfused blood resulted in significantly higher hemoglobin increment. However, RBCs storage time did not affect mortality according to univariate and multivariate analysis.",2022/06//,Springer,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2696943414?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2696943414; 638584015"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""Embase"", ""critically ill patient"", ""major clinical study"", ""Simplified Acute Physiology Score"", ""endogenous compound"", ""blood sampling"", ""acute respiratory failure"", ""outcome assessment"", ""female"", ""morbidity"", ""human"", ""human cell"", ""middle aged"", ""erythrocyte preservation"", ""erythrocyte"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""mortality rate"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""controlled study"", ""conference abstract"", ""mortality"", ""adult"", ""APACHE"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-022-01016-6"", ""issn"": ""21105820"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia rafla_bendabebiss@hotmail.com, Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia, Ben Dabebiss, Rafla, Sahloul University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - French Intensive Care Society International Congress 2022"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2022-08-01"", ""Date revised - 2022-08-01"", ""Last updated - 2022-08-02""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Annals+of+Intensive+Care&rft.atitle=Storage+time+of+transfused+packed+red+blood+cells+and+mortality+in+critically+ill+patients%3A+a+retrospective+study&rft.au=Ben+Dabebiss%2C+Rafla&rft.aulast=Ben+Dabebiss&rft.aufirst=Rafla&rft.date=2022-06-01&rft.volume=12&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Annals+of+Intensive+Care&rft.issn=21105820&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs13613-022-01016-6"", ""date"": ""Jun 2022""}"

Practice patterns in pediatric resuscitation likely have changed as well; however, this evolution has not been quantified. We evaluated pediatric resuscitation practices over time within a combat trauma system. METHODS: The Department of Defense Trauma Registry was queried from 2001 to 2013 for pediatric patients (<18 years). Patients with burns, drowning, and missing injury severity score were excluded. Volumes of crystalloid, packed red blood cells (PRBC), whole blood, plasma, and platelets (PLT) given in the first 24 hours were calculated per kilogram body weight. Tranexamic acid use was also determined. Patients were divided into Early (2001-2005) and Late (2006-2013) cohorts, and subgroups of transfused (TX+) and massively transfused (MT+) patients were created. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay and 24-hour and in-hospital mortality rates were compared. RESULTS: A total of 4,358 patients met inclusion criteria. Comparing Early versus Late, injuries from explosions, isolated or predominant head injuries, and injury severity score all increased. The proportion of TX+ patients also increased significantly (13.6% vs 37.4%, p < 0.001) as did the number of MT+ patients (2.1% vs 15.5%, p < 0.001). Transfusion of high plasma:RBC and PLT:RBC ratios increased in both the TX+ and MT+ subgroups, although overall, PLT and whole blood use was low. After adjusting for differences between groups, the odds of death was no different Early versus Late but decreased significantly in the MT+ patients with time as a continuous variable. CONCLUSION: Transfusion practice in pediatric combat casualty care shifted toward a more hemostatic approach over time. All-cause mortality was low and remained stable overall and even decreased in MT+ patients despite more injuries due to explosions, more head injuries, and greater injury severity. However, further study is required to determine the optimal resuscitation practices in critically injured children.

58cb9501-7979-4e49-be47-e8423ed5b323,Comparison of clinical prediction tools and identification of risk factors for adverse outcomes in acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding,"['Tapaskar, Natalie', 'Jones, Blake A.', 'Mei, Steve', 'Sengupta, Neil']",Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,87,6,AB97,"Background: Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for 20% of GI bleeding. Clinical prediction tools exist to identify patients at high risk for severe bleeding. There is limited data comparing these tools and their ability to predict endoscopic intervention, need for blood transfusion, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Aim: To compare the ability of several clinical scores to predict severe bleeding, endoscopic intervention, and adverse outcomes among patients presenting with LGIB. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study of patients admitted with LGIB who underwent colonoscopy at a tertiary-care medical center between April 2016 and September 2017. We obtained demographics, details of hospital course, and adverse outcomes (severe bleeding). Severe bleeding was defined as per prior studies and included: continued bleeding in the first 24 hours of admission and/or recurrent bleeding after 24 hours of clinical stability. Seven risk scores were calculated at admission (Strate, NOBLADS, Sengupta, Oakland, Blatchford, AIMS65, and Charlson Comorbidity Index). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine risk of adverse outcomes. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to compare the predictive power of each score. Results: A total of 170 patients underwent colonoscopy for LGIB during the study time frame. Demographics are available in Table 1. Fifty-two percent (n=89) had severe bleeding during their hospitalization. Patients with severe bleeding had lower admission hemoglobins (8.6 g/dL vs 11.1 g/dL; p=0.0001), were more likely to have renal failure (30% vs 17%; p=0.05), require blood transfusion (85% vs 36%; p<0.0001), require ICU stay (49% vs 19%; p<0.0001), and had a longer length of stay (6 days vs 4 days; pZ.0009). The best predictor of severe bleeding was the Oakland score (AUC 0.74; p<0.0001), whereas the Strate score performed best for in-hospital re-bleeding (AUC 0.66; p=0.0008) and endoscopic intervention (AUC 0.62; p=0.01). The Blatchford score was best for predicting need for transfusion (AUC 0.87; p<0.0001). In a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, renal disease, malignancy, abdominal examination, admission INR and blood pressure, the strongest individual predictors of severe bleeding were admission hemoglobin (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.91; p=0.0015) and albumin (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.18-0.86; p=0.02).

The aims of this study are threefold: a) to evaluate the objective changes in resuscitation and mass transfusion protocols undertaken in major level I trauma centers; b) to summarize the improvements in diagnostic options for early risk profiling in multiply injured patients and c) to assess the improvements in surgical treatment for acute major fractures in the multiply injured patient. METHODS: I. A systematic review of the literature (comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases) and a concomitant data base (from a single Level I center) analysis were performed. Two authors independently extracted data using a pre-designed form. A pooled analysis was performed to determine the changes in the management of polytraumatized patients after the change of the millennium. II. A data base from a level I trauma center was utilized to test any effects of treatment changes on outcome. INCLUSION CRITERIA: adult patients, ISS > 16, admission < less than 24 h post trauma. Exclusion: Oncological diseases, genetic disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Parameters evaluated were mortality, ICU stay, ICU complications (Sepsis, Pneumonia, Multiple organ failure). RESULTS: I. From the electronic databases, 5141 articles were deemed to be relevant. 169 articles met the inclusion criteria and a manual review of reference lists of key articles identified an additional 22 articles. II. Out of 3668 patients, 2694 (73.4%) were male, the mean ISS was 28.2 (SD 15.1), mean NISS was 37.2 points (SD 17.4 points) and the average length of stay was 17.0 days (SD 18.7 days) with a mean length of ICU stay of 8.2 days (SD 10.5 days), and a mean ventilation time of 5.1 days (SD 8.1 days). Both surgical management and nonsurgical strategies have changed over time. Damage control resuscitation, dynamic analyses of coagulopathy and lactate clearance proved to sharpen the view of the worsening trauma patient and facilitated the prevention of further complications. The subsequent surgical care has become safer and more balanced, avoiding overzealous initial surgeries, while performing early fixation, when patients are physiologically stable or rapidly improving. Severe chest trauma and soft tissue injuries require further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple changes in management (resuscitation, transfusion protocols and balanced surgical care) have taken place. Moreover, improvement in mortality rates and complications associated with several factors were also observed.

Relevantly, significant practice variation in the use of blood products exists among practitioners and institutions, largely because of the lack of robust clinical trial data, in many instances, which are critical for providing practitioners with evidence-based guidelines for appropriate blood product utilization. Recognizing this gap, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recently established a State-of-the-Science Symposium to help define areas of clinical trial research that would enhance the opportunity for developing appropriate practice guidelines for both Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis/Thrombosis. Such a Symposium was held in September 2009 to identify important clinical trial research issues in these 2 subject areas of endeavor. The aims of this Symposium were to specifically identify phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that, if conducted over the next 5 to 10 years, could impact the treatment of patients with hemostatic and other disorders as well as to optimize the use of blood products in patients who need such interventions. This article reports on the deliberations that were held relating to the various clinical trial concepts developed by 7 Transfusion Medicine subcommittees. This Symposium generated a rich assortment of clinical trial proposals that will undergo further refinement before final implementation into pilot or full randomized clinical trials. The various proposals identified many opportunities for clinical trial research and most importantly underscored the ongoing need for well-developed evidence-based clinical trial research in the field of Transfusion Medicine. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",2010/10//,"W.B.

Subjects with early death (<72 h) were excluded. Propensity-score matching of LTOWB and component groups was performed. Adverse events were recorded, including transfusion reaction, thromboembolism, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and organ failure based on PELOD-2 score, along with hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and ventilator days. RESULTS: Thirty-six LTOWB recipients were matched to 36 conventional component recipients. Subjects were 52% male, with blunt injury mechanism (82%), median (IQR) injury severity score = 27 (21-35), and 26% in-hospital mortality.

Study Design/Method: This before-after observational study was conducted with IRB approval. A multidisciplinary PBM program was initiated in 2014 including education with dissemination of AABB best practice guidelines and electronic clinical decision support for transfusion orders. The pre-PBM cohort included patients receiving HSCT from 1/1/2013-9/31/2013 with a post-PBM cohort of 1/1/2015-9/31/2015. All outcomes were assessed from HSCT to post-transplant day 90. Healthcare delivery outcomes included frequency and proportion of RBC and PLT transfusions, total transfusion quantities, transfusions occurring outside of guidelines, and activity-based costs of transfusions. RBCs administered for hemoglobin values greater than 7 g/dL and PLT transfusions for PLT counts greater than 10 × 109/L were considered outside of guidelines, though sensitivity analyses were performed to account for acceptable discordance (e.g. coronary disease, neutropenic fever). Patient-centered outcomes included mortality, hospital and ICU admission rates, transfusion reactions, cerebrovascular and coronary ischemic events, and infections. Results/Finding: 365 patients received HSCT in 2013 and 367 in 2015; both cohorts shared similar demographic and comorbidity profiles. 291 patients (80.0%) were transfused with RBCs in 2013 compared to 232 (63.7%) in 2015 (p<0.0001). Transfusion volumes were lower in 2015 [median (IQR) 3 (2, 4) vs. 2 (1, 4) units for 2013 and 2015, respectively, p=0.004] with RBC transfusion totals of 1179 units in 2013 and 842 units in 2015. In 2013, 287 (99.3%) of RBC transfusions occurred outside of guidelines compared to 117 (50.2%) in 2015 (p<0.0001). Regarding PLT transfusions, 342 patients (93.7%) were transfused in 2013 versus 343 (93.5%) in 2015 (p=0.428); the median transfusion quantity was 3 (2, 5) units in 2013 compared to 2 (1, 4) units in 2015 (p=0.0006) with higher transfusion totals in 2013 (1716 vs. 1456 units). 285 (83.3%) PLT transfusions occurred outside of guidelines in 2013 versus 178 (51.9%) in 2015 (p<0.0001). Activity-based transfusion costs were $3,336,192 and $2,710,352 in 2013 and 2015, respectively. There were no significant differences in patient-centered outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the intensive care unit, transfusion service, and death registry, the long-term survival after using rFVIIa and the associated cost per life-year gained in a consecutive cohort of patients with critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion (≥ 10 red blood cell [RBC] units in 24 hr) were assessed. rFVIIa was only used as a lifesaving treatment when conventional measures had failed. RESULTS: Of the 353 patients with critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion, 81 (23%) required rFVIIa as a lifesaving rescue treatment. The patients requiring rFVIIa received a greater number of transfusions (number of units: RBCs, 18 vs. 12; fresh-frozen plasma, 16 vs. 10; platelets, 4 vs. 2; p < 0.001) and had a shorter survival time (24 months vs. 33 months; p = 0.002) than those who did not require rFVIIa. The total cost per life-year gained of massive transfusion and incremental cost of rFVIIa as a lifesaving treatment were US$1,148,000 (£711,760; 95% confidence interval [CI], US$825,000-US$1,471,000) and US$736,000 (£456,320; 95% CI, US$527,000-US$945,000), respectively. The incremental costs of rFVIIa increased with severity of illness and transfusion requirement and were greater than the usual acceptable cost-effective limit (<US$100,000 per life-year) for most patients with critical bleeding.

However, data to support its utility in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients is lacking. This is in part due to the fact that most transfusions occur within the first 48 hours of admission. There may be a subgroup of patients who may benefit from EPO therapy to prevent later transfusions. The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical rationale and assess the efficacy of EPO in certain PICU patients at risk of requiring blood transfusion. Hypothesis: EPO administration will result in significant rise in hemoglobin in anemic patients in the PICU. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to a tertiary care PICU in 2010 and 2011 that received EPO. Diagnosis, PRISM scores, hemoglobin values (Hgb), number of EPO doses, and transfusions were recorded. Mann-Whitney test and regression analysis were utilized. Values were expressed in means and standard deviations. Results: Of 2595 admissions, 110 received EPO. The average age of the 110 patients (51 females and 59 males) was 7.4 ± 5.4 years and the median PRISM score was 3. Of these, 8 patients had ongoing blood loss and were excluded, 33 were transfused (Group A) and 69 were not (Group B). Pre EPO Hgb was 7.6 gm/dl ± 1.4 vs. 8.8 gm/dl ± 1.2 for group A and B respectively (p =.78). Regression analysis revealed that a higher PRISM score predicted need for transfusions (p =.024). In group B, Hgb rise following EPO therapy was significant in trauma (1.0 gm/dl, p =.018, n = 9) and post-operative (± 0.87 gm/dl, p =.012, n = 31) patients, but not in patients with infections (0.23 gm/dl, p =.573, n = 20). Patients receiving? 3 doses of EPO had higher Hgb rise (1.06 gm/dl ± 1.52) compared to those receiving fewer doses (0.3 gm/dl ± 1.4), p =.05. There were no reported complications. Conclusions: EPO induced a significant hemoglobin rise in sub-acute trauma and post-operative patients but not in patients with infections. Fewer than 3 doses of EPO were not effective, and PRISM score predicted transfusion requirement. This data will be helpful in targeting specific populations in future prospective studies.",2012/12//,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1355595403?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1355595403; 71066220"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""blood transfusion"", ""tertiary health care"", ""infection"", ""bleeding"", ""intensive care"", ""therapy"", ""regression analysis"", ""diagnosis"", ""transfusion"", ""hemoglobin"", ""population"", ""society"", ""patient"", ""prospective study"", ""intensive care unit"", ""risk"", ""injury"", ""erythropoiesis"", ""rank sum test"", ""female"", ""human"", ""hypothesis"", ""male"", ""erythropoietin""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000425605.04623.4b"", ""issn"": ""00903493"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Helen DeVos Children'S Hospital, United Kingdom , DeVos Children's Hospital, United Kingdom , Helen DeVos Children'S Hospital, United Kingdom, Hassan, N., Helen DeVos Children'S Hospital, United Kingdom"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 42nd Critical Care Congress of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, SCCM 2013"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2013-05-25"", ""Date revised - 2013-05-27"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.atitle=Therapeutic+role+for+erythropoietin+in+a+pediatric+intensive+care+unit%3A+An+exploratory+review&rft.au=Hassan%2C+Nabil&rft.aulast=Hassan&rft.aufirst=Nabil&rft.date=2012-12-01&rft.volume=40&rft.issue=12&rft.spage=274&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.issn=00903493&rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2F01.ccm.0000425605.04623.4b"", ""date"": ""Dec 2012""}"
ed9c1a60-06ad-486c-86f8-d95a5395a010,Are we following national guidelines for red blood cell transfusion on our general intensive care unit?,"['Troyan, A.', 'Ritchie-McLean, S.', 'Martin, J.']",Anaesthesia,71,,43,"It is recommended that: ''the default red blood cell (RBC) transfusion threshold for haemoglobin (Hb) in critically ill adult patients should be 70.0 g.l-1 or below, with a target Hb range of 70.0- 90.0 g.l-1 unless specific comorbidities or acute illness-related factors modify clinical decisionmaking. Transfusion triggers should not exceed 90.0 g.l-1 in most critically ill patients'' [1]. These guidelines are based largely on the TRICC trial that showed liberal transfusion policy did not improve intensive care outcomes [2]. Transfusion is associated with risk, may increase mortality [3], and is costly. We present a service evaluation of RBC transfusion practice in our 20- bed general adult ICU, (excluding neurosurgery, trauma, and cardiothoracic surgery). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the notes of 50 consecutive ICU admissions in March 2015. We recorded demographics, date and time of ICU RBC transfusion, indication, number of units, and pre- and post-transfusion Hb as measured by blood gas analysis. For patients not transfused, the lowest ICU Hb, measured by laboratory full blood count was recorded. Results Discussion Our data suggests that we may be able to safely reduce the rates of RBC transfusion on our unit. We found that the Hb was above 70.0 g.l-1 before almost half of all RBC transfusions, without good clinical justification. Also, the post-transfusion Hb was above 90.0g.l-1 after more than half of transfusions. We found no evidence of under-transfusion. Current evidence suggests that reducing our transfusion rates would not be detrimental to patients; indeed it may be beneficial and offers a potential cost saving. Thus we recommend implementation of current national transfusion guidelines in our unit. Our study has many limitations: it is a retrospective evaluation of a small sample of medical notes, and thus there is potential for bias and results may not be an accurate reflection of practice. Burden of disease was not measured but is often high in patients on our unit, thus the TRICC trial results may not be applicable.

The objective of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of EGD in critically ill patients who are using high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for suspected GI bleeding.We retrospectively analyzed ICU patients using high-dose PPI for suspected GI bleeding from January 2012 to September 2020. Major cases of GI bleeding, such as those with hematemesis and hematochezia, were excluded, and 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. The change in hemoglobin level, requirement of red blood cell transfusion, re-suspected bleeding event, length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality were compared between the EGD and non-EGD groups.Of the 174 subjects included, 52 patients underwent EGD within 24 hours of PPI administration. In the EGD group, 22 (42.3%) patients showed normal findings, while esophagitis and gastritis were most common abnormal finding (n = 11, 21.2%), and 14 patients (26.9%) underwent a hemostatic procedure. While comparing the 2 groups, the EGD group required a higher amount of red blood cell transfusion (packs) than the non-EGD group for a week (3.04 ± 0.44 vs 2.07 ± 0.25, P = .01). There was no significant difference in the change in hemoglobin level after 1 week (P = .15). After propensity score matching, the EGD group showed similar the requirement of red blood cell transfusion and change in hemoglobin level for a week (P = .52, P = .97, respectively). In analyses for all patients and propensity score matched patients, there was no statistically significant difference in term of re-suspected bleeding event rate, duration of ICU stay, and ICU mortality. However, re-suspected bleeding event rate and ICU mortality were lower trend in the EGD group than the non-EGD group.This study showed that EGD had no definite clinical benefit in ICU patients using high-dose PPI for suspected GI bleeding and aggressive EGD is not necessarily recommended. However, it is necessary to consider EGD in patients who are tolerant.",2021/08/27/,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2764650882?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2764650882; 2022120273"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""esophagogastroduodenoscopy"", ""gastrointestinal bleeding"", ""intensive care unit"", ""proton pump inhibitor"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""critically ill patient"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"", ""comparative effectiveness"", ""outcome assessment"", ""female"", ""gastritis"", ""human"", ""drug therapy"", ""drug megadose"", ""esophagitis"", ""article"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""hematemesis"", ""hematochezia"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""controlled study"", ""clinical outcome"", ""mortality"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""retrospective study"", ""propensity score""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000027028"", ""issn"": ""00257974"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea wongunnim@naver.com, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, Kwack, Won Gun, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital, 23, Kyungheedae-ro, , Seoul, Dongdaemun-gu, 02447, South Korea"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2023-01-12"", ""Date revised - 2023-01-12"", ""Number of references - 19"", ""Last updated - 2023-01-12"", ""CODEN - MEDIA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Medicine+%28United+States%29&rft.atitle=Clinical+outcomes+of+esophagogastroduodenoscopy+in+critically+ill+patients+using+high-dose+proton+pump+inhibitor+for+suspected+bleeding%3A+A+retrospective+cohort+study&rft.au=Kwack%2C+Won+Gun&rft.aulast=Kwack&rft.aufirst=Won&rft.date=2021-08-27&rft.volume=100&rft.issue=34&rft.spage=E27028&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Medicine+%28United+States%29&rft.issn=00257974&rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2FMD.0000000000027028"", ""date"": ""2021 Aug 27""}"

The current study sought to examine the impact of timing of first cooler delivery on patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients predicted to receive MT at 12 Level I trauma centers were randomized to two separate transfusion ratios as described in the PROPPR trial. Assessment of Blood Consumption score or clinician gestalt prediction of MT was used to randomize patients and call for initial study cooler. In this planned subanalysis, the time to MT protocol activation and time to delivery of the initial cooler were evaluated. The impact of these times on mortality and time to hemostasis were examined using both Wilcoxon rank sum and linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 680 patients, the median time from patient arrival to MT protocol activation was 9 minutes with a median time from MT activation call to delivery of first cooler of 8 minutes. An increase in both time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with prolonged time to achieving hemostasis (coefficient, 1.09; p = 0.001 and coefficient, 1.16; p < 0.001, respectively). Increased time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; p = 0.009 and OR, 1.02; p = 0.012, respectively). Controlling for injury severity, physiology, resuscitation intensity, and treatment arm (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2), increased time to arrival of first cooler was associated with an increased mortality at 24 hours (OR, 1.05; p = 0.035) and 30 days (OR, 1.05, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Delays in MT protocol activation and delays in initial cooler arrival were associated with prolonged time to achieve hemostasis and an increase in mortality. Independent of products ratios, every minute from time of MT protocol activation to time of initial cooler arrival increases odds of mortality by 5%.

A target hemoglobin concentration (g/dL)(Hb) of ≥ 7 g/dL is recommended for mechanical ventilated patients in the ICU to minimize transfusion associated complications. The optimal target hemoglobin for patients recovering from critical illness and now being weaned from PMV is unknown. This study was performed as a first step to establishing target hemoglobin guidelines for patients undergoing weaning from PMV in the post acute care setting. Methods: Retrospective review of hemoglobin levels, weaning outcomes and physical functional status in a consecutive cohort of patients (n=137) admitted for weaning from PMV at an LTACH from January 1, 2006 - December 31, 2007. Physical functional status was recorded on two occasions (admission and discharge). Standard physical therapy evaluations (supine to sit, bed to chair, gait and distance, stairs, total number of stairs, and use of mobility device) were used. Each measure of function was assigned a numerical score and a composite score was also calculated. Results: Of the 137 patients, a subset of 33 (24%) were weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged home. Data are presented on this subset. Decannulation was successful in 79% of these patients. Mean age was 66 ± 15 years and 48% were female. Median LTACH length of stay was 50 (IQR 35, 65) days. Hb increased significantly from admission (10.3 ± 1.0 g/dL) to discharge (11.1 ± 1.6 g/dL) (p = 0.02). Blood transfusion was used in 6 patients (18%). On admission, 24% (n=8) of patients were able to go from supine to sit position with less than minimal assistance. Mean total functional score increased from admission (5.1 ± 3.9) to discharge (21.9 ± 9.7) (p < 0.0001). On discharge, 16 (48%) patients were able to climb > 8 stairs and 24 (73%) required use of a mobility device on discharge. Conclusions: A Hb of 11 g/dL is associated with successfully weaning from PMV, recovery from critical illness and functional discharge to home. These data suggest that the target Hb concentration for patients recovering from critical illness and weaning from PMV in the post acute setting may need to be set higher than those currently recommended in the ICU setting. Further work is needed to determine the minimum Hb needed in the post acute setting to allow for functional recovery.

METHODS: The PBM program had 3 components: monitoring transfusions through an order communication system checklist, educating the medical team about PBM, and providing feedback to ordering physicians on the appropriateness of transfusion. The retrospective analysis examined changes in the hemoglobin levels triggering transfusion and the proportions of appropriate RBC transfusions before, during, and after PBM implementation. Further analysis was focused on patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with outcomes including 30-day mortality, durations of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and rates of pneumonia, sepsis, and wound complications. RESULTS: The study included 2,802 patients admitted for cardiothoracic surgery. After the implementation of PBM, a significant decrease was observed in the hemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion. This threshold dropped from 8.7 g/dL before PBM to 8.3 g/dL during the PBM education phase and 8.0 g/dL during the PBM feedback period. Additionally, the proportion of appropriate RBC transfusions increased markedly, from 23.9% before PBM to 34.9% and 58.2% during the education and feedback phases, respectively. Among the 381 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, a significant reduction was noted in the length of hospitalization over time (p<0.001). However, other clinical outcomes displayed no significant differences. CONCLUSION: PBM implementation effectively reduced the hemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion and increased the rate of appropriate transfusion in cardiothoracic surgery.

No anaphylactic reactions have ever been reported due to transfusion of AP stored in PAS. Aims: The main objective of the study is to understand the reaction occurred due to apheresis platelet transfusion. Methods: An AP product was donated by a blood group A male, processed using PAS. The patient developed severe Hypotension with Tachycardia immediately after 10 minutes of transfusion. Pre-transfusion and Post transfusion recipient vitals showed a marked decrease in Blood Pressure from 110/70 mmHg to 70/50 mm Hg with Pulse increased from 88 bpm to 118 bpm. Oxygen saturations were maintained normal without any changes in respiratory parameters. Serological testing included an antibody screen using gel technology, a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) using immunoglobulin G and C3d, and a Sterility testing of the transfused platelet product. Results: A 61-year-old blood group O patient with Aplastic anemia developed severe hypotension within the first 10 minutes of the start of AP in PAS transfusion despite premedication with Inj. Avil and Inj.Hydrocort. The post-transfusion reaction evaluation was non-significant showing negative antibody screen and also negative DAT, both for immunoglobulin G and C3d; No bacterial growth was seen in the transfused product and patient blood culture was sterile.

Early colonoscopy within 24 hours is recommended by guidelines but it is unclear whether this strategy is associated with improved outcomes. Our aims were to determine factors associated with 30-day rebleeding and readmissions following hospitalization for diverticular bleeding, and to determine whether timing of colonoscopy affected post-discharge outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective study using Marketscan, a nationwide insurance claims database. Patients admitted from 1/2010-12/2014 with a primary diagnosis of diverticular bleeding (ICD-9 562.12) who underwent colonoscopy during hospitalization were included. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards were used to determine risk factors for 30-day all-cause readmissions and rebleeding. Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed to determine whether early colonoscopy (by day 1 of hospitalization) was associated with rebleeding and readmission. Results: 20,011 patients underwent colonoscopy for diverticular bleeding, of whom 420 (2%) had recurrent GIB (median 3 days, IQR 2-10) and 868 (4%) had readmission. Baseline differences in those with recurrent GIB are depicted in Table 1. A higher proportion of those with rebleeding underwent early colonoscopy (87% for rebleeding group vs 77%, p-value < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, variables associated with 30-day rebleeding included a diagnosis of CHF (HR 1.47, CI 1.07-2.02), CKD (HR 1.87, CI 1.25-2.74), performance of RBC transfusion (HR 2.16, CI 1.76-2.65), ICU care (HR 1.50, CI 1.19- 1.88), early colonscopy (HR 1.62, CI 1.19-2.21) and angiography (HR 5.32, CI 1.31-21.67) (Table 2). In a separate multivariable analysis, CHF (HR 1.65, CI 1.36-2.01), malignancy (HR 1.74, CI 1.16-2.61), RBC transfusion (HR 1.88, CI 1.63-2.17), ICU care (HR 1.56, CI 1.33-1.81) and early colonoscopy (HR 1.45, CI 1.22-1.80) were also associated with increased 30-day readmissions (Table 2). In the time to event analysis (Figure 1), patients undergoing early colonoscopy were more likely to experience 30-day rebleeding (log rank p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Rebleeding and readmission are common adverse outcomes following hospitalization for diverticular bleeding and are driven by comorbidity burden and severity of initial bleed. Despite adjusting for confounding, early colonoscopy was associated with worse post-discharge outcomes.",2017/10//,Nature Publishing Group,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2008997487?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2008997487; 620839377"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""insurance"", ""hospital readmission"", ""statistical significance"", ""bleeding"", ""hospitalization"", ""major clinical study"", ""diagnosis"", ""malignant neoplasm"", ""adverse outcome"", ""risk factor"", ""angiography"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""ICD-9"", ""comorbidity"", ""controlled study"", ""cancer recurrence"", ""conference abstract"", ""adult"", ""female"", ""Kaplan Meier method"", ""colonoscopy"", ""human"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2017.302"", ""issn"": ""15720241"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States , University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States, Nigam, Neha, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 82nd Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2018-02-28"", ""Date revised - 2018-02-28"", ""Last updated - 2018-02-28""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=American+Journal+of+Gastroenterology&rft.atitle=Risk+factors+for+30-day+rebleeding+and+readmissions+following+hospitalization+for+diverticular+bleeding&rft.au=Nigam%2C+Neha&rft.aulast=Nigam&rft.aufirst=Neha&rft.date=2017-10-01&rft.volume=112&rft.issue=&rft.spage=S291&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+Journal+of+Gastroenterology&rft.issn=15720241&rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Fajg.2017.302"", ""date"": ""Oct 2017""}"

METHODS: Critically ill trauma patients with a hemoglobin concentration less than 90 g/L within 72 hours of admission to the intensive care unit were randomized to a restrictive (hemoglobin concentration, 70 g/L) or liberal (hemoglobin concentration, 100 g/L) red blood cell transfusion strategy. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics in the restrictive (n = 100) and liberal (n = 103) transfusion groups were comparable. The average hemoglobin concentrations (82.7 +/- 6.2 g/L vs. 104.3 +/- 12.2 g/L; p < 0.0001) and the red blood cell units transfused per patient (2.3 +/- 4.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 4.3; p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the restrictive group than in the liberal group.

This study investigated incidence and etiology in the Netherlands. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From January 2005 through July 2007, all TRALI cases reported to the Sanquin Blood Banks were evaluated. Only cases meeting the Canadian Consensus Conference criteria for TRALI were included and investigated for patient, donor, and product characteristics. Patients and donors were screened for HLA Class I, HLA Class II, and granulocyte antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 56 TRALI cases were reported of which 49 were completely evaluated. Seventy-eight percent of the patients needed monitoring or mechanical ventilation on the intensive care unit, 10 patients died. In 61% of cases large-volume plasma products were involved. WBC-reactive antibodies in donors were found in 73% of cases, with proven incompatibility in 21 of 44 (48%) investigated cases. Possible TRALI cases, as defined by the Canadian Consensus Conference, had significantly lower incompatibility rates compared to TRALI cases, 18% versus 58% (p = 0.036). In the 21 alloimmune cases, a total of 31 implicated donors were found, of which 26 were female, including 12 fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) products. CONCLUSION: TRALI is the most serious transfusion complication in the Netherlands, causing severe morbidity and mortality.

Methods: 43 cases of critical ill patients with severe trauma were included during January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 in ICU of Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. International normalized ratio (INR) >1.2 was applied as the diagnosis criterion of TIC. The patients was divided into TIC group (n=23) and control group (n=20). Their age, sex, injury mechanism, the interval between injury and admission to ICU (delay time), the interval between injury and coagulopathy correction (correction time), ISS scores, APACHE II scores at admission to ICU were recorded, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), INR, fibrinogen (Fib), platelet counts (PLT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels were detected meanwhile. The serum HMGB1 levels were examined through ELISA. The blood transfusion volume (red blood cells, RBC and fresh frozen plasma, FFP), ventilation time, ICU stay and 28-day mortality rate were statistically analyzed. Results: TIC occurred in 53.5% of critical ill trauma patients in ICU. There were no significant differences in the age, sex, injury mechanism, delay time, APACHE II scores, ISS scores, APTT, PT, CRP and PCT levels between two groups (P>0.05). Compared with control group, the Fib and PLT levels were significantly reduced in the TIC group, and the ventilation time, blood transfusion volume of RBC and FFP, infection rate and organ dysfunction rate were remarkably increased (P<0.05). Besides, the 28-day mortality rate revealed a raised tendency in TIC group (P=0.091). Simultaneously, the serum HMGB1 levels at admission to ICU were significantly increased in the TIC group, and the serum HMGB1 level in the death subgroup was much higher than that in the survivors, as same as those in the TIC subgroup analysis (P=0.000). The correlation analysis disclosed that serum HMGB1 levels at admission was positively related to delay time, correction time, APACHE II score, ISS score, ventilation time, INR levels, APTT, CRP and PCT levels at admission (r=0.648, 0754, 0.526, 0.516, 0.521, 0.509, 0.432, 0.592, 0.375), and was negatively associated with Fib levels, PLT value, infection incidence rate, organ dysfunction rate and 28-day mortality rate (r=-0.424, -0.571, -0.505, -0.396, -0.765). There were significant differences in the delay time, correction time, ISS scores, transfusion volume, serum HMGB1 levels, PLT value, APTT and CRP levels between death subgroup and survivor subgroup of TIC patients (P<0.05), and serum HMGB1 levels and PLT value at admission were independent risk factors in the multivariable logistic regression analysis (P=0.004, 0.011). For the TIC sub-group trauma patients, the AUC of serum HMGB1 levels was 0.897(95%CI 0.748-1.000, P=0.002), the best cutoff value was 54.60 ng/ml with Youden index of 0.808. Conclusions: The PLT levels and serum HMGB1 levels at admission to ICU are independent risk factors of critical ill patients with severe trauma.

01d385b2-b8e6-477c-b48d-23e4adc07a6f,Changes in hematocrit following a blood transfusion does not influence the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis: A case-control study,"['Lawrence, Shelley M.', 'Nandyal, R.', 'Hallford, G.', 'Anderson, M.', 'Hart, N.']",Journal of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine,7,1,21-27,"OBJECTIVE: Transfusion Associated Necrotizing Enterocolitis (TANEC) is defined as the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) within 48 hours of receiving a blood transfusion in preterm neonates. We wanted to determine if hematocrit changes following blood transfusions were associated with disease development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case-control analysis of inborn neonates ≤32 weeks' gestational age, from January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010, who were diagnosed with Bell stage II or greater NEC. Those meeting TANEC criteria were identified and an analysis completed to determine if beginning or ending hematocrit values were associated with an increased risk for disease development. RESULTS: Nineteen of forty-nine (39%) infants with NEC met the criteria for TANEC. We found no differences in gestational age at birth or birth weight in our experimental groups. The degree of illness including PDA, IVH, central line use, and respiratory support 48 hours prior to disease onset was also similar between groups. Those with TANEC had higher modified Bell staging of NEC and were more likely to be receiving full enteric feeds at the time of NEC onset. No statistically significant differences were found in hematocrit levels prior to or following the blood transfusion closest to NEC onset in the TANEC group, as compared to classic NEC (CNEC) or control infants. CONCLUSION: The onset of NEC following transfusion occurs with a frequency that invites investigation regarding causation.

ac9f299a-20c4-494c-8c5d-4df6366c482f,Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: Reconciling clinical data with best practice,"['Mirski, Marek A.', 'Frank, Steven M.', 'Kor, Daryl J.', 'Vincent, Jean-Louis', 'Holmes, David R., Jr.']",Critical Care,19,1,,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guidelines correctly promote a general restrictive transfusion approach for anemic hospitalized patients. Such recommendations have been derived from evaluation of specific patient populations, and it is important to recognize that engaging a strict guideline approach has the potential to incur harm if the clinician fails to provide a comprehensive review of the patient's physiological status in determining the benefit and risks of transfusion. We reviewed the data in support of a restrictive or a more liberal RBC transfusion practice, and examined the quality of the datasets and manner of their interpretation to provide better context by which a physician can make a sound decision regarding RBC transfusion therapy. Reviewed studies included PubMed-cited (1974 to 2013) prospective randomized clinical trials, prospective subset analyses of randomized studies, nonrandomized controlled trials, observational case series, consecutive and nonconsecutive case series, and review articles. Prospective randomized clinical trials were acknowledged and emphasized as the best-quality evidence. The results of the analysis support that restrictive RBC transfusion practices appear safe in the hospitalized populations studied, although patients with acute coronary syndromes, traumatic brain injury and patients at risk for brain or spinal cord ischemia were not well represented in the reviewed studies. The lack of quality data regarding the purported adverse effects of RBC transfusion at best suggests that restrictive strategies are no worse than liberal strategies under the studied protocol conditions, and RBC transfusion therapy in the majority of instances represents a marker for greater severity of illness. The conclusion is that in the majority of clinical settings a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy is cost-effective, reduces the risk of adverse events specific to transfusion, and introduces no harm. In anemic patients with ongoing hemorrhage, with risk of significant bleeding, or with concurrent ischemic brain, spinal cord, or myocardium, the optimal hemoglobin transfusion trigger remains unknown.

Children receiving heart transplants constitute a unique group of patients due to their risk factors. Although previous studies in nontransplant patients have focused primarily on the effects of postoperative blood transfusions, a significant exposure to blood occurs during the intraoperative period, and a larger percentage of heart transplant patients require intraoperative blood transfusions when compared with general cardiac surgery patients. We investigated the relationship between clinical outcomes and the amount of blood transfused both during and after heart transplantation. We hypothesized that larger amounts of RBC transfusions are associated with worsening clinical outcomes in pediatric heart transplant patients. METHODS: A database comprising 108 pediatric patients undergoing heart transplantation from 2004 to 2010 was queried. Preoperative and postoperative clinical risk factors, including the amount of blood transfused intraoperatively and 48 hours postoperatively, were analyzed. The outcome measures were length of hospital stay, duration of tracheal intubation, inotrope score, and major adverse events. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to control for simultaneous risk factors and determine outcomes in which the amount of blood transfused was an independent risk factor. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients with complete datasets were included in the final analysis. Eighty-eight percent received RBC transfusions, with a median transfusion amount of 38.7 mL/kg. A multivariate analysis correcting for 8 covariate risk factors, including the Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation, age, weight, United Network for Organ Sharing status, warm and cold ischemia time, repeat sternotomy, and pretransplant hematocrit, showed RBC transfusions were independently associated with increased length of intensive care unit stay (means ratio = 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.76; P = 0.03), and increased inotrope score in the first postoperative 24 hour (mean ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.52; P = 0.04). Patients suffering major adverse events received significantly larger median amounts of blood RBC transfusions (P = 0.002). Transfusions >60 mL/kg were also associated with increased risk of major adverse events (accuracy 76%) including postoperative sepsis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, open chest, dialysis, and graft failure. CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric patients undergoing orthotropic heart transplantation receive RBC transfusions, with the largest amount transfused in the operating room.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The cryoprecipitate policy was changed from transfusing 10ml/kg to a maximum of 1 unit per transfusion in January 2013. Data were obtained via retrospective chart review of all infants receiving cryoprecipitate transfusions from January 2008 to February 2015 in the NICU at Christiana Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 103 neonates received a total of 144 cryoprecipitate transfusions. Before the policy change, term babies were more likely to be exposed to more than one donor compared to preterm babies (75% vs. 6%, p < 0.01). After the policy change, no babies were exposed to greater than one donor per transfusion and there were similar increases in posttransfusion fibrinogen level as before the policy change. CONCLUSION: Limiting cryoprecipitate transfusions to 1 unit per transfusion decreased donor exposure in infants without negatively impacting posttransfusion fibrinogen levels.

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated nonsignificant difference on association between the age of RBCs and adverse clinical outcomes in patients receiving blood transfusion. However, due to limitations associated with the design of RCTs, a final verdict on this issue has not been reached yet, and alternative polices for the use of blood products may be considered as a safety response. An understanding of any potential resulting disruption in the US blood supply levels due to deviation from the standard of care is important fordecision-makers to have as a valuable tool to enable scientifically sound regulatory policies. Study Design/Methods: We refined the Stock-and-Flow simulation model of the US blood supply developed by Simonetti et al in 2014 by introducing a new allocation method to evaluate the impact on supply of preferentially transfusing younger blood to critically ill patients, such as Trauma (TR), Coronary Care Unit (CCU), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and Cardiac Surgery (CS) patients, as opposed to the general recipients. Blood donation information from several regional blood centers and blood utilization from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the period 2007-2012 was used during the simulation to enable the model to estimate the daily amount of blood available in the system. We estimated the mean age of the transfused blood units and the performance of the US blood system achieved for each of the considered simulated scenarios. Results/Findings: Results showed a reduction in the total blood supply of up to 42% compared to the baseline supply levels when preferentially transfusing younger blood units to the selected groups of critically ill patients. More specifically, a reduction in supply of 2.5% was observed in the scenario for TR patients, while 7.8%, 18.6%, and 23.3% were the reductions observed in the scenarios for CCU, ICU, and CS patients, respectively. We observed an inverse correlation between the mean age of blood required for transfusion and both the supply levels and the number of units that failed to meet the daily demand of blood for that age. Conclusion: Our simulation study shows that it is theoretically possible to transfuse younger blood units to selected groups of critically ill, but such practices would reduce the overall blood supply. If any health benefits of transfusing younger blood units are proven, the advantages to critically ill patients and the robustness of the overall blood supply will need to be carefully considered.",2015/09//,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1729609708?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1729609708; 72032389"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""critically ill patient"", ""surgical patient"", ""heart surgery"", ""simulation"", ""medicaid"", ""transfusion"", ""adverse drug reaction"", ""patient"", ""safety"", ""blood donor"", ""coronary care unit"", ""vascularization"", ""intensive care unit"", ""model"", ""injury"", ""human"", ""public health"", ""policy"", ""blood transfusion"", ""health"", ""clinical trial (topic)"", ""health care quality"", ""blood"", ""erythrocyte preservation"", ""police"", ""recipient"", ""medicare""], ""issn"": ""00411132"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States , Acumen LLC, Burlingame, CA, United States , Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States, Simonetti, A., Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - AABB Annual Meeting 2015"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2015-10-08"", ""Date revised - 2015-11-04"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Transfusion&rft.atitle=How+would+strategies+for+transfusing+critically+ill+patients+with+younger+blood+affect+the+us+blood+supply%3F&rft.au=Simonetti%2C+A.&rft.aulast=Simonetti&rft.aufirst=A.&rft.date=2015-09-01&rft.volume=55&rft.issue=&rft.spage=177A&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion&rft.issn=00411132&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""Sep 2015""}"

In case of bleeding emergencies, guidelines strongly recommend a 2:1 transfusion ratio of RBCs and plasma. In addition, each minute delay in issuing of blood products in bleeding emergencies increases the mortality risk. To provide plasma in time in bleeding emergencies, a thawed plasma bank was introduced in 2011. SUMMARY: The thawed plasma bank of University Medicine Greifswald has provided 18,924 thawed stored plasma units between 2011 and 2020. The workflow in the laboratory as well as in the emergency room, the operating room, and the intensive care unit have been optimized by thawed stored plasma. In case of emergencies, the stress factor for the transfusion medicine laboratory staff has been reduced substantially. The thawed plasma bank allows to transfuse patients with massive transfusion demand at a 2:1 ratio of RBCs and plasma according to guidelines. To reduce storage time, we issue all plasma requests from the thawed plasma bank except for pediatric patients. This results in a median storage time in the thawed plasma bank of 24 h. The ""just in time"" availability of plasma within the entire hospital based on the thawed plasma bank has reduced precautionary ordering of plasma, and hereby the unnecessary use of plasma. After introduction of the thawed plasma bank, plasma usage decreased substantially by 24% within the first year and by 60% compared to 2019/2020. However, as the overall approach to using blood products has changed over the last 10 years due to the patient blood management initiative, quantification of the effects of the thawed plasma bank in reduction of plasma transfusion is difficult. KEY MESSAGES: (1) A thawed plasma bank for the routine supply of blood products in a large hospital is feasible in Germany. (2) The thawed plasma bank allows to supply RBCs and plasma in a 2:1 ratio in bleeding emergencies. (3) The beneficial logistical effects of the thawed plasma bank are optimal if all plasma requests are supplied from the thawed plasma bank. This results in a median storage time of 24 h for thawed plasma.",2021,Switzerland,https://doi.org/10.1159/000519700,"{""pmid"": 35082566, ""electronic_issn"": ""1660-3818"", ""print_issn"": ""1660-3796"", ""linking_issn"": ""1660-3796"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101176417"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""keywords"": [""Clotting factor stability"", ""Liquid plasma"", ""Thawed plasma bank""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2021 Dec"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2021-07-05"", ""accepted"": ""2021-09-10"", ""published"": ""2022-01-28"", ""electronic"": ""2021-10-08""}}"

d8ad977a-3ebf-4b10-81bd-6deedaf9e229,Urinary ngal is associated with the developement of aki after stored blood transfusion in criticaly ill patients-an observational study,"['Abdelaziz, Tarek', 'Abdullah, Reham']",Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,33,,i410-i411,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Anemia is common in the critically-ill patients. Acute kidney injury is also common in the intensive care settings. Blood transfusions have been previously shown to predispose to AKI in the surgical and medical patients. NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) is an important marker of early AKI. Studies have previously shown its association with the development of AKI after blood transfusion, in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries. Objective To study the association between the occurrence of AKI (rise in NGAL and serum creatinine) and the age of the blood transfused in critically ill patients. METHODS: We recruited 147 patients admitted to ICU. The Cut-off value for the definition of stored RBCs was 21 days. This was based on the use of acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) as a preservative. AKI was diagnosed based on KDIDO-AKI guidelines criteria. AKI episodes were recorded within 48 hours after PRBCs transfusion. Urinary NGAL (ng/ml) was measured 12 hours after receiving blood transfusion, using the ARCHITECT assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Ill). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of patients are shown in table (1). To show the independent risk that is attributed to blood transfusion, we have adjusted the relative risk according to other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that there is an association between the urinary biomarker NGAL and the development of AKI after blood transfusion in critically ill patients. Previous studies have reported the association in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; however to our knowledge this is the first study to establish this association in the critically ill patients. Conclusion Transfusion of stored PRBC is associated with the development of AKI in critically ill patients.

In the last couple of decades the laparoscopic PD (LPD) has been developed, with good results compared with the open technique (OPD). Objectives: To describe and compare the open and laparoscopic DPs performed in the first year of introduction of advanced laparoscopy at a public hepatopancreatobiliary reference hospital in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Methods: Throughout the surgery records of Hospital Geral Roberto Santos, all the PDs performed from 12/01/2013 to 12/01/2014 were identified. Only the oncologically complete surgeries performed during that period, open or laparoscopic, were selected. Results: In total, 15 PDs were performed, with eight LPDs. The majority of the patients were women, and the mean age was 55.26 years old. The mean length of hospital stay was 55.2 days for OPD and 35.2 days for LDP. The conversion rate was 37.5%. The mean length of stay in the intensive care unit was 11.7 days for OPD and 8.1 days for LPD. The procedure time was 380 min for OPD and 546 min for LPD. Only one patient in the OPD group needed blood transfusion. The fistula incidence was 14.2% for OPD and 25% for LPD. Two patients in the OPD group had anastomotic dehiscence. There was one death in each group, and two reoperations in the OPD and one in the APG group. Conclusions: The DP can be performed laparoscopically with good results when compared with the open technique. In our study, the patients that underwent LPD had a shorter hospital and ICU stay, less use of blood transfusion, and lower dehiscence and reoperation rates. The LPD presented a higher incidence of fistula and a longer time of operation when compared with OPD. Prospective and comparatives studies will be done with the purpose of proving the benefits of LPD.",2015/10//,W.B.

The purpose of this review is to present the current state of knowledge regarding blood transfusion in the critically ill and to identify gaps in our current understanding for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating evidence suggests a lack of efficacy with red blood cell (RBC), plasma, and platelet transfusion in the majority of critically ill patients. Evidence has also increasingly exposed previously under-recognized transfusion risks. The result is a growing number of recommendations for more restrictive RBC, plasma, and platelet transfusion strategies. An important exception to a more conservative transfusion practice occurs in patients with major trauma and life-threatening bleeding. Delaying RBCs, plasma and platelet component therapies in this population can promote the lethal triad of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia with a resultant increase in bleeding, greater transfusion requirements, and higher mortality. SUMMARY: Although we have made substantial progress in understanding the role of blood transfusion in the ICU, multiple important knowledge gaps persist. Future studies are needed to better define and characterize the impact of RBC storage, male-only plasma and platelet donor procurement procedures, and transfusion strategies in those requiring massive transfusion and with acute local or global tissue ischemia.",2010,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0b013e32833bc4a4,"{""pmid"": 20543684, ""electronic_issn"": ""1531-7072"", ""linking_issn"": ""1070-5295"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9504454"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Acidosis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Acute Lung Injury"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Proteins"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Care"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocytes"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hypothermia"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Plasma"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Platelet Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Risk Factors"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2010 Aug"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2010-06-15""}}"

With planned management, careful preparation for surgery should be considered as of equal importance to surgical skill. Early diagnosis and exact resuscitation are the two most important aspects of a plan of treatment which anticipates the need for early surgery. In the past, patients were often referred late for surgery after significant blood loss and transfusion. Surgeons have endeavoured to define the cases that are likely to rebleed and prepare them promptly for surgery. Probably the best indications for early surgery are severe haemorrhage, reflected by shock on admission, an age of over 50 and active bleeding from the ulcer seen at diagnostic endoscopy.

Journal canadien de chirurgie,59,6,399-406,"BACKGROUND: Reoperative mitral valve (MV) surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; however, endoscopic minimally invasive surgical techniques may preserve the surgical benefits of conventional mitral operations while potentially reducing perioperative risk and length of stay (LOS) in hospital.METHODS: We compared the outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent reoperative MV surgery between 2000 and 2014 using a minimally invasive endoscopic approach (MINI) with those of patients who underwent a conventional sternotomy (STERN). The primary outcome was in-hospital/30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included blood product transfusion, LOS in hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU), and postoperative complications.RESULTS: We included 132 patients in our study: 40 (mean age 68 ± 14 yr, 70% men) underwent MINI and 92 (62 ± 13 yr, 40% men) underwent STERN. The MINI group had significantly more comorbidities than the STERN group. While there were no significant differences in complications, all point estimates suggested lower mortality and morbidity in the MINI than the STERN group (in-hospital/ 30-day mortality 5% v. 11%, p = 0.35; composite any of 10 complications 28% v. 41%, p = 0.13). Individual complication rates were similar between the MINI and STERN groups, except for intra-aortic balloon pump requirement (IABP; 0% v. 12%, p = 0.034). MINI significantly reduced the need for any blood transfusion (68% v. 84%, p = 0.036) or packed red blood cells (63% v. 79%, p = 0.042), fresh frozen plasma (35% v. 59%, p = 0.012) and platelets (20% v. 40%, p = 0.024). It also significantly reduced median hospital LOS (8 v. 12 d, p = 0.014). An exploratory propensity score analysis similarly demonstrated a significantly reduced need for IABP (p < 0.001) and a shorter mean LOS in the ICU (p = 0.046) and in hospital (p = 0.047) in the MINI group.CONCLUSION: A MINI approach for reoperative MV surgery reduces blood product utilization and hospital LOS.

RECENT FINDINGS: Careful consideration should be paid to look for pulmonary vascular dysfunction and acute kidney injury, because of their prognostic role during acute vaso-occlusive manifestations. Alloimmunization and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions are emerging complications that should be thought to be diagnosed, as they may imply a conservative management. The life-threatening complication raises the question about the indications of blood transfusion therapy for acute sickle cell disease complications, no randomized controlled trials being available to assess the role of blood transfusion in the acute setting.

We present our data and experience over the last 8 years in managing such patients. BACKGROUND:: There is paucity of data on management and outcomes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who do not accept blood-derived products. STUDY:: We performed a retrospective study of patients from 2003 to 2011 presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding who do not accept blood-derived products. Inclusion criteria were either overt bleeding with a presenting hemoglobin (Hb) of <12 g/dL or a decrease in Hb of >1.5 g/dL. RESULTS:: Ninety-six patients who met the inclusion criteria were included. Forty-one upper and 48 lower gastrointestinal bleeding sources were identified. Mean Hb was 8.8 g/dL and mean nadir was 6.9 g/dL. Among 37 patients (80.5%) with Hb ≤6.0 g/dL, 30 (81%) survived. Four of 7 patients (57%) with a Hb <3 g/dL survived. The overall mortality rate was 10.4%. In unadjusted logistic regression models, age [1.06 (1.01-1.12 y)], admission to ICU [6.37(1.27-31.9)], and anticoagulation use [6.95 (1.57-30.6)] were associated with increased mortality. Initial Hb [0.68 (0.51-0.92)] and nadir Hb [0.48 (0.29-0.78)] inversely predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS:: These results suggest that transfusion-free management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be effective with mortality comparable with the general population accepting medically indicated transfusion.

A policy of using small volumes (pediatric phlebotomy tubes, reduced syringe volumes) for the most frequent laboratory tests was implemented in our medical ICU. We prospectively studied 151 patients admitted during two consecutive 10-wk periods. During period 2, DBL was displayed on each ICU flow sheet. The DBL/day (43.6 ± 3 [SEM] ml) was significantly lower (62.6 ± 4 ml) than it would have been if standard volume tubes had been used. This represented an average savings of 33%. During period 1 (n = 81), eight (10%) patients with no diagnosis involving blood loss had a decrease in Hct and received transfusion. DBL was significantly higher (316 ± 81 vs. 168 ± 18 ml, p < .001) for these patients and represented an average of 17% of transfusion requirements. During period 2 (n = 70), such transfusion requirements were significantly reduced (only one of 70, p < .001), as were tests ordered/day (7.8 ± 0.5 vs. 9.5 ± 0.6, p < .05). We conclude that DBL is a major health problem for the ICU patient. Routine use of small specimen volumes in this setting is warranted.

The process includes the necessity of a medical history taken to determine if a donor is suitable to donate, which shall guarantee both donor and recipient safety. Supplementary screening for a limited number of infections is performed by antibody (HIV, HCV, syphilis) or antigen (HBV) tests or NAT (HIV, HCV, HBV). Case Presentation: With regard to a possible infection due to (sexual) risk behavior or foreign travel, blood donation facilities are predominantly dependent on information provided by the donor. This is especially true for malaria in nonendemic areas such as Europe. Transmission of malaria by a blood transfusion in a nonendemic country that led to fulminant septic shock and death of the patient happened. Discussion: From a legal perspective, the donor thus assumes a high level of responsibility with regard to the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on the donor questionnaire.

bd995446-eeae-417a-9d70-d8c86c80e936,Balanced Blood Product Transfusion during Adult Liver Transplantation,"['Milani, Soheila', 'Aghaee, Monavvar Afzal', 'Shademan, Hamideh', 'Khodarahmi, Nima', 'Toloue, Razia']",Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal,24,11,,"Background: Orthotopic liver transplant (LT) is often associated with massive blood loss and significant transfusion requirements. Recent recommendations for resuscitation strategy in massive bleeding include the transfusion of balanced blood products, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, packed red blood cells (PRBC), and restricted use of crystalloids. Objectives: To evaluate whether the intraoperative transfusion ratio of fresh frozen plasma to packed red blood cell units (FFP: PRBC ≤1:1 versus >1:1) plays a positive role in reducing PRBC transfusion in LT. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 84 liver transplant recipients who received at least one PRBC unit during the surgery. The patients were grouped into those who received intraoperative FFP: PRBC ratio ≤1:1 (low ratio) versus the ratio>1:1 (high ratio). Selected perioperative variables were compared between the two groups. Results: Patients in the low-ratio versus high-ratio group had lower intraoperative requirements for PRBC (P<0.001). Importantly, in the high-ratio group, the mean postoperative PRBC transfused units were 1.76 times that of the low-ratio group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.76; 95% CI=1.07-2.90).

Ideally, red blood cells (RBC) transfusion should be tailored to the individual requirements of the single infant. However, despite the progress in neonatal transfusion medicine, many controversies still remain, and the decision on whether to transfuse or not is often made on empirical basis, with large variation in transfusion practices among neonatologists. Recently, a few clinical trials have been performed with the aim to compare the risk/benefit ratio of restrictive versus liberal transfusion criteria. Most of the studies failed to demonstrate significant differences in short-term outcomes, suggesting that the restrictive criteria may reduce the need for transfusion and the related side effects. Neurodevelopmental long-term outcome seemed more favorable in the liberal group at a first evaluation, especially for boys, and significantly better in the restrictive group at a later clinical investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging scans, performed at an average age of 12 years, showed that intracranial volume was substantially smaller in the liberal group compared with controls. When sex effects were evaluated, the girls in the liberal group had the most significant abnormalities.

Whilst intravenous iron may decrease anaemia and RBC transfusion requirement, safety and efficacy in critically ill patients is uncertain. Methods: The multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, Intravenous Iron or Placebo for Anaemia in Intensive Care (IRONMAN) study was designed to test the hypothesis that, in anaemic, critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit, early administration of intravenous iron, compared with placebo, reduces allogenic red blood cell transfusion and increases haemoglobin to hospital discharge. Results: Of 140 patients enrolled, 70 were assigned to intravenous iron and 70 to placebo. The iron group received 97 red blood cell units versus 136 red blood cell unit in the placebo group, incidence rate ratio 0.71 [95% confidence interval (0.43-1.18) P=0.19]. Overall, median haemoglobin at hospital discharge was significantly higher in the intravenous iron group compared with the placebo group (107 (IQR 97-115) vs. 100 g/L (IQR 89-111), P=0.02). There was no significant difference between the groups in any safety outcome.

02a77776-4689-40e3-a58a-00476704d78d,Assessment of pattern and effectiveness of neonatal transfusion practices,"['Dogra, K.', 'Basu, S.', 'Kaur, G.', 'Chawla, D.']",Vox Sanguinis,111,,248,"Background: Transfusion practices demand special precautions due to the small blood volume and immature organ systems in neonates. Although physiologic anaemia of infancy is self-limited, anaemia due to repeated phlebotomy, sepsis, on-going bleeding, etc., requires transfusion of blood/blood components. Although neonatal transfusion guidelines exist, many issues pertaining to transfusion triggers, dosage and clinical outcomes still remain debatable. Hence, we conducted a study to get an insight into the neonatal transfusion practice, prevailing at our centre. Aim: The study aims to evaluate the usage of blood products, donor exposure among neonates and efficacy of transfusion to neonates admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in the NICU, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India by recruiting neonates of gestational age ≥ 26 weeks, birth weight >700 g and duration of stay in NICU >6 h and excluding neonates with major congenital malformations. Each of the transfusion events was assessed by product details, indication of transfusion, haematocrit, donor exposure, platelet count and PT/INR. Packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion affecting clinical parameters was assessed by pre- and post-transfusion parameters viz. respiratory support, lactate levels, weight gain, inotropic support, respiratory distress and haematocrit. Platelet and FFP transfusions were assessed by presence or absence of bleeding. Result: Of total 291 neonates admitted in NICU, 2 neonates had congenital malformations and were excluded. The mean gestational age and mean birth weight of neonates were 33.2 ± 3.2 weeks and 1776 ± 483.4 gms, respectively. Of 289 neonates, 61 newborns received blood product transfusion. The average number of donor exposures per patient was 1.6. The pre-transfusion and post transfusion hematocrits were 18-36% and 21-39%, respectively. The pre-transfusion platelet count ranged from 10,000 to 86,000/μl (Mean: 36,881 ± 17,579/μl). The post transfusion platelet count of these neonates ranged from 12,000 to 2,00,000/μl (Mean: 55,775 ± 37,407/μl). The pre-transfusion and post transfusion INR values were 1.19-2.96 and 1.00-2.43, respectively. Increment in lab parameters was seen in all newborns (P < 0.05) except for 3 neonates. These results may be attributed to the presence of sepsis, ongoing thrombocytopenia and bleed. It was also found that the effects on clinical parameters like weight gain, respiratory support, apnoeic episodes were not significant (P > 0.05). The mean difference between post-transfusion and pre-transfusion lactate levels was 0.6 mmol/L (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Based on observations, we concluded that no clinical benefits of PRBC transfusions were seen on parameters like weight gain, episodes of apnea and respiratory support. Also no benefits of platelet and FFP transfusions were seen on bleeding. Hence, severity of complications and ongoing bleeding determine the clinical outcome. As the neonates were not followed up for long term, complications of transfusion might have been missed.",2016/09//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1816976293?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1816976293; 611869181"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""lactic acid"", ""113-21-3"", ""50-21-5"", ""apnea monitoring"", ""bleeding"", ""cohort analysis"", ""thrombocytopenia"", ""major clinical study"", ""assisted ventilation"", ""weight gain"", ""hematocrit"", ""international normalized ratio"", ""inotropism"", ""thrombocyte count"", ""government"", ""congenital malformation"", ""gestational age"", ""human"", ""birth weight"", ""Chandigarh"", ""newborn"", ""medical school"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""exposure"", ""clinical outcome"", ""neonatal intensive care unit"", ""respiratory distress"", ""sepsis""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.12429"", ""issn"": ""14230410"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India , TMC, Kolkata, India , GMCH, Chandigarh, India , All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, Dogra, K., All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 34th International Congress of the International Society of Blood Transfusion"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2016-09-06"", ""Date revised - 2016-09-06"", ""Last updated - 2016-09-07""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.atitle=Assessment+of+pattern+and+effectiveness+of+neonatal+transfusion+practices&rft.au=Dogra%2C+K.&rft.aulast=Dogra&rft.aufirst=K.&rft.date=2016-09-01&rft.volume=111&rft.issue=&rft.spage=248&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.issn=14230410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fvox.12429"", ""date"": ""Sep 2016""}"

Leukocyte alloantibodies in the plasma of the transfused blood products and patient leukocytes play a leading role in the pathogenesis of TRALI. Reduction of TRALI risk is possible by implementing donor selection and by processing blood components. The objective of this study was to quantify the implementation of TRALI reduction interventions in the Czech Republic in 2019. The questionnaire sent out was completed by 51 blood banks (100%). Plasma for clinical use was produced by 47 blood banks (BB) in 2019. 37 BB (78.7%) implemented strategies to reduce the incidence of TRALI from their plasma blood components. 17 BB provided plasma from male donors without a history of transfusions, 13 BB used plasma from male donors without a history of transfusions and female donors without a history of pregnancy and transfusions, 7 BB used plasma from male donors, but did not determine their transfusion history. 5 BB performed additional testing of leukocyte antibodies. 10 BB did not perform any interventions to reduce TRALI risk. For 5 BB, the implementation of interventions would be complicated due to shortage of plasma products, logistical requirements, storage facilities, computer system modifications, risk of plasma deterioration and more expensive production.

New evidence has emerged documenting the risks associated and lack of efficacy or improvement in clinical outcome with blood transfusion for the treatment of anemia in critically ill patients who are hemodynamically stable. Recent findings: The safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse only if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL) was reported in 1999. Despite compelling evidence from this prospective randomized clinical trial, clinicians have not substantially changed practice regarding blood transfusion in critical care. The recently published CRIT trial reported that the mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin was 8.6 g/dL in this large multicenter trial that examined transfusion practices in critical care in the US. Furthermore, only 19% of hospitals had an institutional blood transfusion protocol. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines have also recommended blood transfusion only when hemoglobin falls to 7.0 g/dL, following resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of significant coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage. We have an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of the anemia associated with critical care, related to the inflammatory response, downregulation of erythropoietin, and lack of iron availability due to macrophage sequestration. Clinical trials are underway to confirm the efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin in the treatment of critically ill patients with anemia. Summary: Current data regarding blood transfusion thresholds and risks of blood transfusion have not as yet significantly altered practice patterns. Efforts to reduce blood transfusion rates in critically ill patients are required. These strategies will require education, unit and institutional protocols, and reduction of phlebotomy for diagnostic laboratory testing in the intensive care unit.

Several solutions to the processes of anemia, such as blunted erythropoietin production and erythropoietin response and abnormalities in iron metabolism have been developed. The transfusion of RBCs provides immediate correction of low hemoglobin levels, which may be of value in patients with life-threatening anemia. Avoidance of RBC and blood component transfusion, however, is becoming increasingly important as data of adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients become clearer. Although the optimal hemoglobin in critically ill patients is not determined, this organ system has a generous reserve. Short-term compensated anemia is tolerated well, while exogenous erythropoietin allows patients to achieve higher hemoglobin concentrations without exposure to transfused blood/blood components. A recent randomized trial enrolled over 1300 critically ill patients to receive either 40,000 units of exogenous erythropoietin or placebo. These authors found that patients randomized to erythropoietin received significantly less allogeneic RBC transfusions and had significantly greater increases in hemoglobin. Although no differences were found between groups in gross clinical outcomes (ie, death, renal failure, myocardial infarction), this study did not have the power to identify small differences in outcomes. This and other studies of exogenous erythropoietin therapy in critically ill patients clearly demonstrate that the bone marrow in many of these patients will respond to the administration of erythropoietin despite their illness, suggesting a blunted production of erythropoietin rather than a blunted response to erythropoietin. Exogenous erythropoietin therefore represents a therapeutic option for treating anemia in critical illness. Acute events in medicine and surgery often lead to many patients becoming anemic. Solutions to this process of anemia should be focused on preventing such events. Anemia after surgery represents an area for prevention. Blood conservation strategies can be performed with adequate results. Monk et al randomized 79 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy to preoperative autologous donation (PAD), preoperative exogenous erythropoietin therapy plus ANH immediately following induction of general anesthesia, and ANH alone. This study concluded that all three techniques resulted in similar hemostasis outcomes (eg, bleeding and transfusion rates), but ANH alone was the least expensive, and ANH plus exogenous erythropoietin and ANH alone resulted in a higher ICU hematocrit compared with PAD. Regardless of these prophylactic strategies, patients still become anemic after surgery or during critical illness. This acute event anemia usually is treated with RBC transfusion; however, autologous blood recovery (cell salvage systems) has been shown to be effective in patients with acute bleeding-related anemia, and this may reduce patients' exposure to allogeneic blood in these patients. There are no universally accepted treatment guidelines for managing anemia, and practice differs between clinicians, hospitals, regions, and countries. Transfusion medicine is evolving and incorporating many new pharmacological agents into the armamentarium of anemia and bleeding therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that anemia in critically ill patients is common and correlated with poor outcomes. The management of anemia can improve outcomes; however, the optimal management of anemia is not performed universally. New approaches, continued research, and an understanding of anemia may result in more consistent and improved outcomes for critically ill patients.",2004,United States,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccc.2004.01.002,"{""pmid"": 15135458, ""print_issn"": ""0749-0704"", ""linking_issn"": ""0749-0704"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""8507720"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Anemia"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Anemia"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Anemia"", ""qualifier"": ""physiopathology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Anemia"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Loss, Surgical"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Illness"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythropoiesis"", ""qualifier"": ""physiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythropoietin"", ""qualifier"": ""therapeutic use"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Inflammation"", ""qualifier"": ""blood"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""United States"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2004 Apr"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2004-05-12""}}"

Optimal cytoreduction aims to achieve no visible tumor or residual disease less than 1 cm. This surgical procedure often has high morbidity due to the surgical complexity. The objective of the presented analysis is to identify whether using the Ligasure® Maryland-jaw open sealer/divider (LMjsd) with nanocoating facilitates cytoreductive surgery by reducing intraoperative bleeding and therefore other parameters regarding hospitalization. Methodology Women with stage III/IV ovarian cancer who were referred to the Department of Gynaecologic Oncology, 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Papageorgiou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, and were subjected to primary/interval cytoreductive surgery were retrospectively allocated into two distinct groups, depending on whether the LMjsd was used or not. The comparison focused on differences between the two groups regarding intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion, duration of surgery, blood transfusion within the post-operative course, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and overall hospital length of stay. Results Between January 2012 and April 2022, 306 ovarian cancer patients were surgically treated; of these, 230 were stage III/IV. In the group of women (N=56), who were operated on using the LMjsd, duration of surgery (p<0.001) was increased, but blood loss (p<0.001) during surgery was significantly decreased compared to cases treated without the LMjsd (N=174). The intra-operative blood transfusion rate, but not the amount of transfused packed red blood cells (p=0.752), was significantly decreased in the first group (p=0.032), whereas post-operative blood transfusion rate was not affected (p=0.063). Moreover, ICU and overall hospital length of stay were significantly decreased in cases where the LMjsd was used (p<0.001 for both parameters). Conclusion The LMjsd is associated to less intra-operative bleeding and transfusion rates; ICU and overall hospital length of stay is improved in women subjected to cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.",2022/10//,BMJ Publishing Group,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2754127256?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2754127256; 639741724"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""general hospital"", ""cancer surgery"", ""major clinical study"", ""nanocoating"", ""operation duration"", ""Greece"", ""laparoscopic tissue sealer and cutter"", ""intensive care unit"", ""female"", ""human"", ""blood transfusion"", ""jaw"", ""operative blood loss"", ""advanced cancer"", ""hospitalization"", ""cytoreductive surgery"", ""human cell"", ""erythrocyte"", ""gynecology"", ""ovary cancer"", ""cancer staging"", ""controlled study"", ""cancer patient"", ""conference abstract"", ""length of stay"", ""adult"", ""obstetrics"", ""surgery""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-ESGO.542"", ""issn"": ""15251438"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece , 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, Tsolakidis, Dimitrios, 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - European Congress on Gynaecological Oncology, ESGO 2022"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2022-12-14"", ""Date revised - 2022-12-14"", ""Last updated - 2022-12-14""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Gynecological+Cancer&rft.atitle=UTILIZATION+OF+LIGASURE+MARYLAND+JAW+OPEN+SEALER%2FDIVIDER+WITH+NANOCOATING+IMPROVES+PERIOPERATIVE+PARAMETERS+IN+WOMEN+WITH+ADVANCED+OVARIAN+CANCER+SUBJECTED+TO+CYTOREDUCTIVE+SURGERY&rft.au=Tsolakidis%2C+Dimitrios&rft.aulast=Tsolakidis&rft.aufirst=Dimitrios&rft.date=2022-10-01&rft.volume=32&rft.issue=&rft.spage=A253&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=International+Journal+of+Gynecological+Cancer&rft.issn=15251438&rft_id=info:doi/10.1136%2Fijgc-2022-ESGO.542"", ""date"": ""Oct 2022""}"

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health care data of nonbleeding patients admitted between November 2004 and May 2016 at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. We analyzed the associations between transfusion (yes/no) and next-day SOFA scores (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-as a measure for organ functioning) for all observed combinations of hemoglobin values (between 6 and 9 g/dL) and concurrent clinical variables. RESULTS: Data of 6425 ICU admission of 5756 critically ill patients with 28,702 hemoglobin values between 6 and 9 g/dL (transfusion decision moments) of which 22.1% were followed by a transfusion were analyzed. The adjusted average difference between the next-day SOFA score of transfused versus not-transfused patients was 0.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.03 to 0.18).

The influences on coagulopathy and bleeding tendency in severely injured patients (SIP) with concomitant traumatic brain injury are most widely unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the effect of mild IH in SIP with concomitant severe traumatic brain injuries on transfusion rate and mortality. METHODS: In this retrospective multi-centre study, SIP from three European level-1 trauma centres with an ISS ≥16 between 2009 and 2011 were included. At hospital A, patients qualified for IH with age ≤70 years and a severe head injury with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS(Head)) of ≥3. IH was defined as target core body temperature of 35 °C. Hypothermic patients were matched with two patients, one from hospital B and one from hospital C using age and AIS(Head). The effect of IH on the transfusion rate, complications and mortality was quantified with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Patients not treated with IH in hospital A and those from hospital B and C, who were not matched, were used to adjust the CI for the effect of inter-hospital therapy protocol differences. RESULTS: Mean age of patients in the IH-group (n = 43) was 35.7 years, mean ISS 30 points and sex distribution showed 83.7 % male. Mean age of matched patients in the normotherm-group (n = 86) was 36.7 years, mean ISS 33 points and there were 75.6 % males. For the hypothermic patients, we pointed out an estimate of mean difference for the number of transfused units of packed red blood cells as well as for mortality which does not indicate a decrease in the benefit gained by hypothermia. It is suggested that hypothermic patients tend to a higher rate of lung failure and thromboembolisms. CONCLUSION: Though tending to an increased rate of complications, there is no evidence for a difference in both; rate of transfusion and mortality in SIP. Mild IH as an option for severe head injuries seems as well-being practicable in the presence of multiple severe injuries.

Between 2002 and 2010, a total of 225 consecutive patients underwent 229 LTx with technical aspects as follows: median donor age was 55 years (range 12-93), PT feasibility and >2U packed RBC transfusion rates were 100% and 23%, respectively, and median operating time was 390 min (range 210-800). Median CIT was 400 min (range 130-870). Median AST peak was 400 mmol/L (range 20-16900) and PDF rate was 7.5% (17 patients).

Poisoning with colchicine results in acute gastroenterocolitis, multiple organ failure and bone marrow suppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate intensive support therapy and mortality in Colchicum autumnale poisoning. Methods: This was a retrospective study of all Colchicum autumnale poisoned patients admitted at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana between 2000 and 2014. The inclusion criterion was serum colchicum confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The medical files of enrolled patients were reviewed and comparisons were made using the chi-square test. Results: A total of 13 Colchicum autumnale poisoned patients (mean age 58 years, 43% men) were included. All patients mistakenly ingested Colchicum autumnale instead of wild garlic (Allium ursinum) and developed acute gastroenterocolitis on average 5 hours after ingestion. In total 20% (3/13) of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive support therapy was acute respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock (3/3) that caused death in two patients on the third day after ingestion. They were all treated with assisted mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, but only the patient who survived developed leukopenia with sepsis that was treated with a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and antibiotics. This patient also received haemodialysis due to acute kidney failure in the second week. Leukopenia also developed in two additional patients who were not treated in the intensive care unit. They received prompt granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy and did not develop infection. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions were given to two patients in the intensive care unit (2/3). Platelet transfusion was also indicated in two additional patients (2/10) not treated in the intensive care unit. The patients requiring intensive support therapy had increased serum troponin (p = 0.01) and decreased cardiac output detected by echocardiography (p = 0.01) compared to the other colchicine poisoned patients. Conclusion: The mortality in Colchicum autumnale poisoning was 15%. Intensive support therapy is indicated in acute respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock that can be predicted by a positive serum troponin concentration.

The majority of these infants receive transfusions of packed red blood cells, usually based on haemoglobin values below a certain threshold. The haemoglobin or haematocrit thresholds used to guide transfusion practices vary with infant status and among institutions and practitioners. Previous smaller studies have not given clear guidance with respect to the haemoglobin thresholds that should trigger transfusions or even if this is the best way to decide when to transfuse an infant. Two large clinical trials of similar design comparing higher and lower haemoglobin thresholds for transfusing extremely low birthweight infants were recently published, the ETTNO and TOP trials. These trials found reassuringly conclusive and concordant results. Within the range of haemoglobin transfusion thresholds studied, there was no difference in the primary outcome (which was the same in both studies), neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years' corrected age or death before assessment, in either study. In addition, there was no difference in either study in either of the components of the primary outcome. In conclusion, haemoglobin transfusion thresholds within the ranges used in these trials, 11-13 g/dL for young critically ill or ventilated infants and 7-10 g/dL for stable infants not requiring significant respiratory support, can be safely used without expecting adverse consequences on survival or neurodevelopment.A review of the current evidence for red cell transfusions for preterm infants.",2022/03/01/,BMJ Publishing Group,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2522903074?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2522903074; 634921827"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Review"", ""keywords"": [""neonatology"", ""therapeutics"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""7:Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""critically ill patient"", ""patient safety"", ""prematurity"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""assisted ventilation"", ""Review"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""Iowa"", ""extremely low birth weight"", ""outcome assessment"", ""human""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320495"", ""issn"": ""13592998"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States edward-bell@uiowa.edu, Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States, Bell, Edward F, Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2022-03-17"", ""Date revised - 2022-03-18"", ""Number of references - 29"", ""Last updated - 2022-03-18"", ""CODEN - ADCHA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=Archives+of+Disease+in+Childhood%3A+Fetal+and+Neonatal+Edition&rft.atitle=Red+cell+transfusion+thresholds+for+preterm+infants%3A+Finally+some+answers&rft.au=Bell%2C+Edward+F&rft.aulast=Bell&rft.aufirst=Edward&rft.date=2022-03-01&rft.volume=107&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=F126&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Archives+of+Disease+in+Childhood%3A+Fetal+and+Neonatal+Edition&rft.issn=13592998&rft_id=info:doi/10.1136%2Farchdischild-2020-320495"", ""date"": ""2022 Mar 01""}"
aa3efeb6-1dd2-49c3-960b-17a035cb9534,Prophylactic plasma transfusion is not associated with decreased red blood cell requirements in the critically ill with abnormal coagulation tests,"['Warner, M.A.', 'Chandran, A.', 'Schenck, L.', 'Kor, D.J.']",Transfusion,55,,26A,"Background/Case Studies: Critically ill patients with abnormal coagulation tests are frequently transfused with plasma on the basis of the assumptions that abnormal coagulation tests confer increased risk of bleeding and that correction of abnormal coagulation values will decrease this risk. However, the impact of prophylactic plasma transfusion in this population remains poorly understood. Study Design/Methods: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at a single institution between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Inclusion criteria included an age greater than 18 years, an International Normalized Ratio (INR) measured during their ICU admission, and valid research authorization. Univariate and multivariable propensity-matched analyses were used to evaluate associations among coagulation abnormalities, prophylactic plasma transfusion, and the outcomes of interest, with a primary outcome of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 24 hours of the qualifying INR value. For patients with multiple INR values who did not receive plasma, the highest INR value during their first ICU encounter was used. In plasma transfused patients, the INR immediately preceding plasma transfusion was used. Results/Findings: A total of 27,561 patients were included in the investigation, with 2472 (9.0%) receiving prophylactic plasma. In univariate analyses, plasma administration was associated with higher rates of RBC transfusion [OR: 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9 - 3.6), p<0.0001], as well as increased mortality [OR: 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2 - 2.7), p<0.0001] and fewer ICU free days [- 0.08 days (95% CI: -0.10 - -0.06), p<0.0001]. In propensity-matched analyses, patients receiving plasma had higher RBC transfusion rates [OR 2.6 (95% CI: 2.2 - 3.2), p<0.0001] and increased mortality [OR: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1 - 1.6), p=0.002]. There was no difference in ICU free days [0.02 days (95% CI: -0.07 - 0.002), p=0.07]. In total, 6,247 patients (22.7%) had an INR value ≥1.5, of whom 1457 (23.3%) received prophylactic plasma. In propensity-matched analysis limited to those with abnormal INR, plasma administration was associated with higher RBC transfusion rates [OR 2.5 (95% CI: 1.9 - 3.3), p<0.0001]. There was no difference in ICU free days [- 0.03 days (95% CI: -0.09 - 0.03), p=0.31] or mortality [OR: 1.1 (95% CI: 0.9 - 1.4), p=0.33].

In Japan, the dose of LZD is not generally adjusted by renal function or therapeutic drug monitoring and is readily available for critically ill patients. The adverse effects of LZD include pancytopenia, especially thrombocytopenia. We investigated the effect of LZD on platelet counts in critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Fifty-five critically ill patients with existing thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 ×103 /μL) who received LZD for five days or more during the period from January 2011 to October 2018 were included. Changes in platelet count and frequency of platelet concentrate (PC) transfusion were evaluated retrospectively. Results Mean (± standard error) platelet count prior to initiation of LZD was 47 ± 4 ×103 /uL, which increased significantly to 86 ± 13 ×103 /uL on day 15 (p<0.01). Median [interquartile range] duration of LZD therapy was 9 [8-12] days. Thirty-two patients (58.2%) required PC transfusion in the 15-day study period. The daily rate of PC transfusion decreased from 30.2% on days 1-5 to 18.2% on days 11-15. Similar tendencies were observed in patients with nonhematological and hematological disease.

We investigated the prevalence of reported IHD at admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and investigated how this influenced red cell transfusion triggers. We also compared observed practice with the clinicians' responses to clinical scenarios. METHODS: We studied 1023 sequential ICU admissions over 100 days to 10 Scottish ICUs. Daily haemoglobin, red cell transfusion, and haemorrhage data were available for 99.4% of 5638 ICU patient days. We recorded if IHD was recorded in clinical records at ICU admission. We grouped admissions as having a non-cardiac primary ICU diagnosis and no documentary evidence of IHD (Group 1, n=697), a non-cardiac primary ICU diagnosis with evidence of IHD (Group 2, n=213), or a cardiac primary ICU admission diagnosis (Group 3, n=113). We examined pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentration (Hb) for transfusion episodes not associated with haemorrhage. Clinical transfusion scenarios were sent to intensivists in the ICUs after data collection, which were designed to explore the clinicians' attitude to transfusion triggers in patients with IHD. RESULTS: Previous myocardial infarction was documented in 159 (16%), cardiac failure in 142 (14%), and angina in 167 (16%). Overall, 28.8% of admissions had >/=1 of these documented. The adjusted mean (se) pre-transfusion Hb concentrations varied across the groups. These were 74 (2.2) g litre(-1) in Group 1, 77 (2.3) g litre(-1) in Group 2, and 79 (3.1) g litre(-1) in Group 3 (P=0.003 across the groups). There was concordance between observed practice and responses to the scenario similar to Group 1, but discordance for patients with IHD (Groups 2 and 3). In scenario responses, intensivists stated these patients should have significantly higher transfusion triggers than were actually observed (median [IQR] response for both groups: 90 [80-100] g litre(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: About 29% of patients admitted to Scottish ICUs had documented IHD, which was associated with small adjustments to Hb transfusion triggers. In response to scenarios, clinicians believe that patients with IHD require higher transfusion triggers than are observed in practice.",2005,England,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aei073,"{""pmid"": 15708870, ""print_issn"": ""0007-0912"", ""linking_issn"": ""0007-0912"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""0372541"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Multicenter Study"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adolescent"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Attitude of Health Personnel"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Child"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Care"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Illness"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemoglobins"", ""qualifier"": ""analysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Medical Audit"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Myocardial Ischemia"", ""qualifier"": ""blood"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Myocardial Ischemia"", ""qualifier"": ""complications"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Myocardial Ischemia"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Patient Admission"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Patient Selection"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prevalence"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Professional Practice"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Scotland"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Surveys and Questionnaires"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2005 Apr"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2005-02-15"", ""electronic"": ""2005-02-11""}}"

Before July 2016, a “private” policy was in place that involved the assignment of a single RBC unit to one neonate for transfusion needs until patient discharge or the expiration of the unit. The new “public” policy involved sharing a single fresh RBC unit among all neonatal patients in need of transfusion until the RBC unit became more than 10 days old. This was put forth with the goal of conserving type O blood. In August 2017, this policy was reconsidered due to concern with an increase in donor exposures. As a result, the policy was modified further. A “shared” policy evolved, which allows up to three neonates to be assigned to a single RBC while the unit is fresh (<10 days old). Those three patients remain assigned to that single unit for any additional transfusion requests for the duration of admission until expiration or exhaustion of the unit. If the patient requires additional transfusions, the patient would be assigned to another fresh unit. This assessment compares the RBC exposure rates of neonates and the number of unique RBCs used among the three different policies adopted at this transfusion service. Study Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing the average donor exposure of neonates transfused between the three policies used. In addition, the number of unique RBC units required by each policy was analyzed. Data was collected using the laboratory's electronic transfused patient log to capture each neonate receiving a RBC transfusion during each policy window for comparison. Results/Findings: Conclusions: The long-standing “private” policy was identified to be wasteful with the use of blood resources. The “public” policy demonstrated a decrease in the number of RBC units required. However, it also demonstrated a significant increase in RBC exposure rates for neonates. The “shared” policy was able to demonstrate donor exposure rates equivalent to rates of the original “private” policy, while also demonstrating a decrease the number of RBC units required. This study underscores the delicate balance required by clinical policy makers to achieve optimal patient outcomes while also ensuring the wise use of limited blood resources.

Our aim was to critically examine if there are discernible physiological benefits to RBC transfusion in patients with respiratory failure, individuals who are susceptible to transfusion-related adverse events. Materials and methods: This is a single-centre, cross-sectional study including mechanically ventilated adults who were not bleeding and underwent an isolated RBC transfusion for a haemoglobin level of <7 g/dl identified on a routine blood draw. We recorded vital signs and variables related to organ function (gas exchange, laboratory data and severity of illness) in the six hours pre-and post-transfusion that might plausibly benefit from the transfusion. Results: Seventy-four patients met the inclusion criteria. There were no improvements in vital signs, laboratory data, vasopressor requirements and overall illness severity after RBC transfusion. Gas exchange as measured by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, however, worsened (pre-transfusion 233±106, post-transfusion 199±92; p=0.01), an association which held after multivariate adjustment in the two time periods. Conclusions: We found no change in common physiological parameters after RBC transfusion in patients intubated for hypoxaemic respiratory failure. In fact, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio worsened slightly. This might be related to an adverse effect of the transfusion, perhaps mediated by a volume effect or direct lung injury.

9fb82bda-1383-4d8a-b915-929c126e1b04,Acute Chest Syndrome in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Italy: Results of a National Survey from the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP),"['Munaretto, Vania', 'Colombatti, Raffaella', 'Tripodi, Serena Ilaria', 'Paola, Corti', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Arcioni, Francesco', 'Piccolo, C.', 'Mina, Tommaso', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Cuzzubbo, Daniela', 'Casale, Maddalena', 'Palazzi, Giovanni', 'Notarangelo, Lucia', 'Masera, Nicoletta', 'Russo, Giovanna', 'Sainati, Laura']",Blood,134,,2301,"Background: Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) is the second cause of hospitalization in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), burdened by significant morbidity and mortality. The guidelines regarding management of ACS are sometimes difficult to follow in the real world and the prevention and treatment strategies of ACS are often applied in an uneven manner in the various settings (community care, regional hospitals, reference university centers). Moreover, epidemiology, clinical phenotype and outcomes as well as risk factors could vary in different populations according to ethnicity, genotype or health care system organization. Aims and Methods: A retrospective multicenter observational study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology of ACS and to the evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of ACS in children with SCD (age 0-18 years) in the 2013-2018 period, after the publication of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP) Guidelines for the Management of SCD in Childhood in Italy in 2012. Results: 126 children were recruited and 122 included in the analysis, with 208 evaluable episodes of ACS (range: 1-6 episodes /patient) from 11 AIEOP Centers. 73 M, 49 F. Mean age was 10.9 years. 85% patients were of African origin, 92% were HbSS/SB°; mean age at diagnosis of SCD of the entire cohort was 25,3 months (range 0-16,8). 44.2% of patients had more than one episode of ACS during the study period; 37% had had a previous episode before 2013. 58% had comorbidities, mostly respiratory (asthma or allergy). 75% of the patients underwent disease modifying treatment during study period (73% hydroxyurea, 2% chronic transfusion). The seasonality of ACS episodes was important in our country: 75% of episodes occured between October and March. 95% of ACS episodes were secondary to a Vaso-Occlusive Crisis. 76% of the admissions occurred in SCD reference centers, 24% in regional hospitals, but 30% later required transfer to reference centers for worsening of clinical conditions or need of exchange transfusion. The mean length of hospitalization was 9.6 days (range 1-46); one patient died of pneumococcal sepsis; 6 episodes required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, mechanical ventilation was required in one episode. A good adherence to the AIEOP Guidelines was documented for some aspects: 99% of the patients were hospitalized, 98% performed chest X-ray for the diagnosis of ACS and in 99% antibiotic therapy was started. Others aspects were less satisfactory and in need of improvement: incentive spirometry was only performed in 19% of admissions; oxygen therapy was performed only in 75% of patients even if SatO2 was<95%; transfer to reference centers was not always timely. During 75% of ACS episodes a simple red cell transfusion was required for Hb>8g/dl, while in 16% an exchange transfusion was performed for severe respiratory distress (of these 71% were performed in patients transfered from regional hospitals); 38% required inhaled bronchodilators, 6% steroids. A preliminay evaluation of risk factors for recurrent ACS showed that in our cohort allergy to inhaled allergens (p 0.02) and enuresis (p 0.01) were associated with increased prevalence of recurrent ACS; patients with asthma/wheezing also presented more recurrent ACS compared to patients wihout them (23% vs 13%) but this data did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: This study represents the first analysis in Italy of ACS, which is confirmed as a frequent event in our cohort, with a significant proportion of patients who experience recurrent ACS. Steps need to be undertaken to improve management of ACS and adherence to the AIEOP guidelines at a national level: stimulate the application of early preventive measures that are still under-utilized, increase the appropriateness of multidisciplinary specialist approach (transfusion specialist, acute care physicians, pneumologists, hematologists) strengthen the dissemination of information through training events for all the Hospitals of the network.

Material and Method: This retrospective study involved patients admitted to the ICU between September 2015 and February 2020. A restrictive transfusion strategy was applied during the study period, in which hemoglobin levels were kept between 7.0 and 9.0 g/dL, and the recommended threshold for RBC transfusion was <7 g/dL, except for patients with acute coronary disease, acute cerebrovascular event, heart failure, severe hypoxemia, or undergoing hip fracture surgery, for whom hemoglobin levels were kept at ≥8 g/dL. Results: Six hundred seventeen patients were included in the study (age 70±16 years, 51.7% male), with a mean hemoglobin level of 11.1±2.3 g/dL on admission. RBC transfusion was performed on 204 (33.1%) patients, and admission hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in the transfused than the non-transfused patients (9.4±1.9 vs. 11.9±2.1 g/dL; p<0.001). ired high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressor use, and had longer ICU and hospital stays. ICU, in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality rates were significantly high among transfused patients.

New sepsis definitions focus on suspected infection and organ damage (1). No point-of-care tests currently exist to precisely define infection presence and severity. Inflammation and coagulation are closely linked: thrombotic and bleeding complications often occur during sepsis and septic shock, resulting in increased mortality. Thromboelastography (TEG®) and point-of-care viscoelastic methods quickly assess the whole coagulation process and seem to be correlated with disease severity in septic patients (2,3). Surviving Sepsis Campaign reconsidered the role of biomarkers, but Presepsin and Copeptin displayed potential correlation with sepsis and its complications. OBJECTIVES. To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of seriated TEG, Presepsin and Copeptin, in patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) with sepsis. METHODS. This is a multicenter prospective observational study conducted in 4 Italian Hospitals. Adult patients with sepsis/septic shock admitted to ICU were included. Conventional blood tests, TEG analysis and biomarkers were obtained at admission (T0), after 72 hours (T1) and after 7 days (T2). Bleeding events, transfusions requirement, clinical data and scores were recorded up to day 7. ICU/hospital length of stay and 28 and 90-days-mortality were recorded. RESULTS. The study is currently ongoing, 43 patients (M/F = 29/14; mean Age = 67, 95%CI 63-72) have been enrolled so far. Preliminary results report four cases of bleeding at T0 (9%) and 6 overall (14%). Patients with lower MA values at TEG displayed more bleeding events and higher need of transfusion at T1 and T2. Patients who died within 28 days reported lower MA levels than surviving (56.2 ± 23.8 vs 81.2 ± 5.9, p < 0.05). A pattern of hypocoagulability (MA ≤ 51mm) seems associated with longer ICU [30 (25-42) vs 11 (9-13) days] and hospital length of stay [37 (29-39) vs 28 (20-33), p < 0.05]. Data regarding Copeptin and Presepsin are preliminary and currently under investigation. CONCLUSIONS. According to our preliminary analysis lower MA measured by TEG seems to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and need of transfusion in patients with sepsis/septic shock. Moreover, an hypocoagulability status among septic patients correlates with an increased mortality rate and longer ICU and hospital length of stay.",2017/09//,SpringerOpen,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1960680445?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1960680445; 619043909"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""copeptin"", ""complication"", ""septic shock"", ""bleeding"", ""human tissue"", ""disease course"", ""aged"", ""hypocoagulability"", ""mortality rate"", ""observational study"", ""thrombosis"", ""biological marker"", ""clinical article"", ""prospective study"", ""length of stay"", ""intensive care unit"", ""multicenter study"", ""adult"", ""female"", ""human"", ""male"", ""thromboelastography""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-017-0151-4"", ""issn"": ""2197425X"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""AOU Città Della Salute E Della Scienza, Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Turin, Italy , AOU Città Della Salute E Della Scienza, Clinical Biochemistry, Turin, Italy , Policlinico Universitario A.

Canadian Medical Association Journal,58,2,S17,"Background: Most patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) are subjectively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for routine monitoring. This study will attempt to derive a clinical predictor tool to identify adult emergency department (ED) patients with mild to moderate TBI who are at low risk for requiring critical care intervention (CCI) during hospitalization; therefore, not requiring ICU monitoring. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients (> 18 years of age) presenting to the ED with mild to moderate TBI. The need for ICU admission was defined as the presence of at least one CCI within the first 48 hours of admission. A list consisting of 1290 patients was extracted from the trauma database and investigated. We performed simple statistical analysis and univariate regression after the completion of data collection and elimination of non-qualifying subjects. The set of pre-defined CCIs included red blood cell transfusion, fresh frozen plasma transfusion, mechanical ventilation, neurosurgery, invasive monitoring, cardiac arrhythmia or arrest, vasopressor use, inotrope use and interventional angiography. Results: Three hundred fiftyeight patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Of these patients, 140 (39.1%) received at least 1 CCI. The variables shown to be associated with a lower risk of requiring 1 or more CCI were age < 65, male gender, absence of pre-injury anticoagulation and the radiological absence of a skull fracture, intraventricular hemorrhage and/or midline cerebral shift.

METHODS: Prospective analysis of 190 critically injured patients who underwent massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activation or received massive transfusion (>10 U of packed red blood cells [RBC] per 24 hours). Cause of death was adjudicated into one of four categories as follows: (1) exsanguination, (2) early physiologic collapse, (3) late physiologic collapse, and (4) nonsurvivable injury. RESULTS: A total 190 patients underwent massive transfusion or MTP with 76 deaths (40% mortality), of whom 72 deaths were adjudicated to one of four categories: 33.3% died of exsanguination, 16.6% died of early physiologic collapse, 11.1% died of late physiologic collapse, while 38.8% died of nonsurvivable injuries. Patients who died of exsanguination were younger and had the highest RBC/fresh frozen plasma ratio (2.97 [2.24]), although the early physiologic collapse group survived long enough to use the most blood products (p < 0.001). The late physiologic collapse group had significantly fewer penetrating injuries, was older, and had significantly more crystalloid use but received a lower RBC/fresh frozen plasma ratio (1.50 [0.42]). Those who were determined to have a nonsurvivable injury had a lower presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, fewer penetrating injuries, and higher initial blood pressure reflecting a preponderance of nonsurvivable traumatic brain injury. The average survival time for patients with potentially survivable injuries was 2.4 hours versus 18.4 hours for nonsurvivable injuries (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Severely injured patients requiring MTP have a high mortality rate. However, no studies to date have addressed the cause of death after MTP. Characterization of cause of death will allow targeting of surgical and resuscitative conduct to allow extension of the physiologic reserve time, therefore rendering previously nonsurvivable injury potentially survivable.",2013,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/TA.0b013e31829a24b4,"{""pmid"": 23883917, ""electronic_issn"": ""2163-0763"", ""print_issn"": ""2163-0755"", ""linking_issn"": ""2163-0755"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101570622"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cause of Death"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Exsanguination"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Glasgow Coma Scale"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Injury Severity Score"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Resuscitation"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Shock, Hemorrhagic"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Time Factors"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2013 Aug"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2013-08-02""}}"
ed09c6c0-84e9-485e-ab41-6a2779273da1,Association between plasma transfusions and clinical outcome in critically ill children: A prospective observational study,"['Karam, O.', 'Lacroix, J.', 'Robitaille, N.', 'Rimensberger, P.C.', 'Tucci, M.']",Vox Sanguinis,104,4,342-349,"Background and Objectives: Plasma transfusions are commonly used in adult and paediatric intensive care units. Recent data suggest an association between plasma transfusions and worse clinical outcome in adult trauma patients. To date, no prospective paediatric study has addressed this issue. Our objective was to prospectively analyse the association between plasma transfusions and clinical outcome of critically ill children. Materials and Methods: Prospective, observational and single centre study that includes all consecutive admissions to a tertiary level multidisciplinary paediatric critical care unit over a 1-year period. The primary outcome measure was the incidence after transfusion of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Secondary outcome measures included nosocomial infections, intensive care unit length of stay and 28-day mortality. Odds ratios were adjusted for weight, severity of illness, coagulopathy, plasma transfusions prior to admission, need for extracorporeal life support and transfusion of other labile blood products. Results: A total of 831 patients were enrolled, among which 94 (11%) received at least one plasma transfusion. In the latter group of patients, the adjusted odds ratio for an increased incidence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was 3·2 (P = 0·002). There was also a significant difference in the occurrence of nosocomial infections and intensive care unit length of stay, but no significant difference in the 28-day mortality.

Previous studies may have been confounded by the re-transfusion of shed mediastinal blood, which has a high concentration of S100β. Aim: To examine serum S100β levels in coronary artery surgery patients in whom re-transfusion of shed mediastinal blood was avoided, and to compare levels with and without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods: Serum S100β levels were measured preoperatively, pre-heparin, post-protamine and 24 h postoperatively in 31 patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery with (n = 14) or without (n = 17) CPB. The postoperative values were compared to their preoperative controls using two-tailed paired t-tests. Results: There was a minor increase in serum S100β post-protamine in the CPB group only (0.41 ng/mL; P<0.01). All other levels in both groups were within normal limits. Conclusions: Coronary artery surgery without CPB is not associated with an increase in serum S100β. The observed increase in the CPB group was four- to ninefold lower than levels previously reported. A possible explanation for the lower level was the avoidance of retransfusing shed mediastinal blood.

The mainstay of treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia remains platelet transfusion although it is important to note that no studies have yet shown clinical benefit of platelet transfusion in this setting. Indeed some reports even suggest that there may be significant adverse effects of platelet transfusion in neonates, including increased mortality, and that the effects of transfusion may differ in different groups of neonates with similar degrees of thrombocytopenia [Bonifacio L, Petrova A, Nanjundaswamy S, Mehta R.

The purpose of this study was to describe the perioperative care given in the management of this particular population of women who have undergone a caesarean section (CS). Methods: This was a retrospective, descriptive study at a single tertiary institute over a one-year period (1 January to 31 December 2018) at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. The aim of this study was to describe the anaesthetic and surgical management of CS-related haemorrhage in an MNM population. The primary objectives were to determine the MNM rate from CS-related obstetric haemorrhage during the study period and to describe the intervention strategies employed in perioperative management for women with CS-related obstetric haemorrhage. The secondary objectives were to determine factors associated with massive transfusion and major estimated blood loss. The primary outcome was the MNM rate for CS deliveries. Results: A total of 8 306 women had CS of whom 105 (1.26%) were classified as MNM due to bleeding during and after the procedure. The median age was 28, with a median parity of 2 (44%), and overall estimated median (IQR) blood loss volume of 1 800 (1 200–2 100) ml. The leading cause of haemorrhage was postpartum haemorrhage (87%). Eighteen (17%) of the women had relook surgery for postpartum CS sepsis. Age and parity of ≥ 3 had a univariate association with major estimated blood loss. The use of general anaesthesia and parity of ≥ 3 had an adjusted association with the institution of massive transfusion protocol (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–27.01 and aOR 3.88, 95% CI 1.47–10.25, respectively). Conclusion: MNM from bleeding during or after a CS occurred in approximately 1 in 80 women who delivered by CS. These women required multiple interventions to arrest the haemorrhage and to achieve haemodynamic stability. Women with a higher parity and undergoing general anaesthesia were associated with severe bleeding. Approximately 1 in 4 women required an exploratory laparotomy and less than 7% required a hysterectomy.",2021,Medpharm Publications,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2748525239?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2748525239; 2018753013"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""caesarean section"", ""maternal near-miss"", ""obstetric haemorrhage"", ""postpartum haemorrhage"", ""tranexamic acid"", ""1197-18-8"", ""701-54-2"", ""Embase"", ""29:Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""fluid resuscitation"", ""university hospital"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""Article"", ""hysterectomy"", ""laparotomy"", ""operation duration"", ""cystoscopy"", ""perioperative care"", ""intensive care unit"", ""outcome assessment"", ""spinal anesthesia"", ""vagina bleeding"", ""female"", ""vaginal delivery"", ""human"", ""postoperative hemorrhage"", ""postpartum hemorrhage"", ""blood transfusion"", ""tranexamic acid -- drug administration"", ""hemodynamics"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""cesarean section"", ""adult"", ""antepartum hemorrhage"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.36303/SAJAA.2021.27.6.2613"", ""issn"": ""22201181"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Anaesthesiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa rebeccaiputo@gmail.com, Division of Global Surgery, Department of Surgery, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa , Department of Anaesthesiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, Iputo, R., Department of Anaesthesiology, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2022-12-23"", ""Date revised - 2022-12-23"", ""Number of references - 17"", ""Last updated - 2022-12-23""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Southern+African+Journal+of+Anaesthesia+and+Analgesia&rft.atitle=Perioperative+management+of+caesarean+section-related+haemorrhage+in+a+maternal+near-miss+population%3A+a+retrospective+study&rft.au=Iputo%2C+R.&rft.aulast=Iputo&rft.aufirst=R.&rft.date=2021-01-01&rft.volume=27&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=286&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Southern+African+Journal+of+Anaesthesia+and+Analgesia&rft.issn=22201181&rft_id=info:doi/10.36303%2FSAJAA.2021.27.6.2613"", ""date"": ""2021""}"

Nonsurvivors received more total units of FFP during hospitalization than survivors (8.0 ± 1.7 units vs 3.1 ± 0.4 units, P < .0001) because of the FFP units transfused in the ICU (5.5 ± 1.2 units vs 1.1 ± 0.2 units, P < .0001). The overall FFP:PRBC transfusion ratio in survivors was 1:4, whereas mean FFP:PRBC volume ratio in nonsurvivors was 3:4 (P < .0001). Nonsurvivors received more platelets (3.4 ± 1.0 units vs 0.50 ± 0.1 units, P < .001) and cryoprecipitate (1.9 ± 0.9 units vs 0.3 ± 0.1 units, P < .001) than survivors, both in the operating room and in the ICU. Blood product use in children with severe burns is associated with increased mortality. Appropriate use of blood products may need to be different in the operating room (massive acute hemorrhage) vs the ICU (ongoing red cell senescence).",2011,England,https://doi.org/10.1097/BCR.0b013e318204b3ea,"{""pmid"": 21107270, ""electronic_issn"": ""1559-0488"", ""linking_issn"": ""1559-047X"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101262774"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Burns"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Burns"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Child"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Intensive Care Units"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Length of Stay"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Operating Rooms"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Survival Rate"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2011 Jan-Feb"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2010-11-26""}}"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The surgeries were performed at the intensive care unit theatre of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. Eligibility for surgery was determined by the Cardiologist and the cardiovascular Surgeon based on clinical presentation, electro- and echocardiography assessments among other tests. Fourteen open-heart surgeries were conducted. Blood products demand for different procedures and several peri-operative laboratory parameters such as full blood count, and coagulation profile were determined. RESULTS: The greatest demand for blood products was found in valvular surgery and atrial septal defect (ASD) where a mean of four units of red cell concentrate, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate were transfused. Other surgeries such as, patent ductus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot did not require much transfusion of blood products. Overall, the pre-operative and post-operative haematocrit, white cell count, platelet count, and international normalized ratio (INR) mean were 37% /25%,4.9 X 10 9/L / 11.4 X 10 9/L, 182 X 10 9/L/ 97 X 10 9/L, and 1.15/ 2.2 respectively.

These patients appear to be a unique subset of all patients requiring Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) activation. Methods: We performed a two year, single-center, retrospective analysis of all non-trauma activations of the MTP in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We compared the blood utilization for patients with GI bleeding to those who had other non-trauma sources of massive hemorrhage. We evaluated the demographics, ICU parameters, laboratory values, BT activity and 30-day patient outcomes in both cohorts. Results: A total of 72 MTP activations were evaluated in 2013 and 2015 33.3% (N= 24) were for patients with GI bleeding. Patients with GI bleeds had an average age of 56.0 ± 14.5 years. 33% (N = 8) were female with a median duration of 184 minutes of activation. The 30-day mortality for patients with GI bleed was 41.7% (N= 10), 60-day mortality was 50% (N= 12). The lowest hemoglobin for patients with GI bleeding was 6.4 ±1.9 g/dL. Patients with GI bleed received a median of 8 (IQR 5, 16) units of red blood cells, 8.5 (IQR 3.3, 15.8) units of plasma, 3 (IQR 1, 7.5) units of apheresis platelets. These averages were compared to patients with non-GI bleeding in our ICU (Table 1). Conclusion: Patients with massive GI bleeding have been proven to benefit from conservative transfusion practices. The threshold for transfusion was significantly lower for patients with GI bleeding compared to those with non-GI bleeding. The number of blood components transfused, 30 and 60-day mortality were not statistically different between both groups.

We focus on four subsets of critically ill patients: pediatric patients, patients with gastrointestinal bleeds, septic patients and patients undergoing cardiac surgery.Recent findingsAlmost a decade after the TRICC trial, a randomized trial showing the safety of a restrictive transfusion threshold in critically ill patients, four large randomized controlled trials have shown that a restrictive transfusion strategy is safe in pediatric critically ill patients, patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeds, patients with septic shock and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A large multicenter randomized trial is underway to determine the safety of a restrictive strategy in myocardial infarction.SummaryA restrictive transfusion threshold is recommended in nearly all critically ill patients. This is at least noninferior to more liberal transfusion practice; in addition, a restrictive threshold has shown improved outcomes in some patients and decreased chances of adverse events in patients. Judicious use of red cells improves patient outcome and protects the blood supply, a limited resource.

METHODS: All patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve operations were identified in the 2015-2021 University of California Cardiac Surgery Consortium repository. The primary end point of the study was length of stay (LOS). Secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality, acute kidney injury, reoperation, postoperative blood transfusion and duration of intensive care unit admission (ICU LOS). Linear regression, gradient boosted machines, random forest, extreme gradient boosting predictive models were developed. The coefficient of determination and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) were used to compare models. Important predictors of increased resource use were identified using SHapley summary plots. RESULTS: Compared with all other modeling strategies, gradient boosted machines demonstrated the greatest performance in the prediction of LOS (coefficient of determination, 0.42), ICU LOS (coefficient of determination, 0.23) and 30-day mortality (AUC, 0.69). Advancing age, reduced hematocrit, and multiple-valve procedures were associated with increased LOS and ICU LOS. Furthermore, the gradient boosted machine model best predicted acute kidney injury (AUC, 0.76), whereas random forest exhibited greatest discrimination in the prediction of postoperative transfusion (AUC, 0.73). We observed no difference in performance between modeling strategies for reoperation (AUC, 0.80).

While the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START), Revised Triage Sieve (rTS), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) tools are user-friendly in a prehospital setting, there is currently no standardized on-scene triage protocol in Thailand Emergency Medical Service (EMS). Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the precision of these tools (SI, rSIG, and NEWS) in predicting the severity of trauma patients who are transferred to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional and diagnostic research conducted on trauma patients transferred by EMS to the ED of Ramathibodi Hospital, a university-affiliated super tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, from January 2015 to September 2022. We compared the on-scene triage tool (SI, rSIG, and NEWS) and ED triage tool (Emergency Severity Index) parameters, massive transfusion protocol (MTP), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission with the area under ROC (univariable analysis) and diagnostic odds ratio (multivariable logistic regression analysis). The optimal cut-off threshold for the best parameter was determined by selecting the value that produced the highest area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were traumatic patients transported by EMS to the ED, out of which 161 were classified as ESI levels 1-2, while the remaining 57 patients were categorized as levels 3-5 on the ESI triage scale. We found that NEWS was a more accurate triage tool to discriminate the severity of trauma patients than rSIG and SI.

This lead to a high rate of empirical prophylactic transfusion, which has been associated to increased complications and cost. The best strategy to guide transfusion in these patients remains unclear. Our aim was to compare three strategies to guide blood component transfusion prior to central venous catheterization (CVC) in critically ill cirrhosis patients. Methods: Single center, randomized, double‐blinded, controlled clinical trial conducted in Brazil [1]. All cirrhosis patients admitted to the ICU with indication for a CVC were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to three transfusion strategies based on: (1) standard coagulation tests (SCT), (2) rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and (3) restrictive. The primary outcome was proportion of transfusion of any blood component prior to CVC. Secondary outcomes were incidence of major and minor bleeding, ICU length of stay (LOS), and 28‐day mortality. Analysis was intention‐to‐treat. Results: 57 participants (19 in each group) were enrolled between September 2014 and December 2016. Most were male (64.9%) and listed for liver transplantation. The study ended after reaching efficacy in first interim analysis. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics among groups. Regarding primary endpoint, there was 14 (73.7%), 13 (68.4%), and 3 (15.8%) events in SCT, ROTEM and restrictive groups, respectively (p <0.001). There was no difference between SCT and ROTEM groups (p >0.99). Overall 28‐day mortality was 33.3% and was similar between groups. ICU LOS did not differ between groups. There was no major bleeding. Overall minor bleeding occurred in 10.53% with no difference between groups. Conclusions: A restrictive strategy is safe and effective in reducing the need of blood component transfusion prior to CVC in critically ill cirrhosis patients.

Transfusion thresholds are often lower for the elderly, despite the lack of clinical evidence for this practice. This study examined the role of age as a predictor for blood transfusion. METHODS: A total of 1898 patients were identified who had nonemergent cardiac surgery, between January 2007 and August 2013, without intra-aortic balloon pumps or reoperations, and with short (<24 hours) intensive care unit stays (age ≥75 years; n = 239). Patients age ≥75 years were propensity-score matched to those age <75 years to balance covariates, resulting in 222 patients per group. Analyses of the matched sample examined age as a continuous variable, scaled in 5-year increments. RESULTS: After matching, covariates were balanced between older and younger patients. Older age significantly predicted postoperative (odds ratio = 1.39, P = .028), but not intraoperative (odds ratio = 0.96, P = .559), blood transfusion. Older age predicted longer length of stay (B = 0.21, P < .001), even after adjustment for blood product transfusion (B = 0.20, P < .001). As expected, older age was a significant predictor for poorer survival, even with multivariate adjustment (hazard ratio = 1.34, P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a routine postoperative course, older age was associated with more postoperative blood transfusion. Older age was also predictive of longer length of stay and poorer survival, even after accounting for clinical factors. Continued study into effects of transfusion, particularly in the elderly, should be directed toward hospital transfusion protocols to optimize perioperative care.",2015,United States,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.03.022,"{""pmid"": 25896463, ""electronic_issn"": ""1097-685X"", ""linking_issn"": ""0022-5223"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""0376343"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Age Factors"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Care"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": true}], ""keywords"": [""Transfusion"", ""cardiac surgery"", ""elderly""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2015 Jul"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2014-06-25"", ""accepted"": ""2015-03-15"", ""published"": ""2015-04-22"", ""revised"": ""2015-03-09"", ""electronic"": ""2015-03-19""}}"

To the best of our knowledge, no trial exists that investigated the effect of platelet transfusion in combination with the administration of balanced vWF in severe blood loss, despite being widely used in clinical practice. The Basel Will‐Plate study will investigate the impact of the timely administration of balanced vWF (1:1 vWF and FVIII) in addition to platelet transfusion on the need for blood and coagulation factor transfusion in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who suffer from severe bleeding. The study hypothesis is based on the assumption that adding balanced vWF to platelets will reduce the overall need for transfusion of blood products compared to the transfusion of platelets alone. Methods and analysis: The Will‐Plate study is an investigator‐initiated, single‐centre, double‐blinded randomised controlled clinical trial in 120 critically ill patients needing platelet transfusion. The primary outcome measure will be the number of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions according to groups. Secondary outcome measures include the number of platelet concentrates transfused within the first 48 h after treatment of study medication, quantity of blood loss in the first 48 h after treatment with the study medication, length of stay in ICU and hospital, number of revision surgeries for haemorrhage control, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, 30‐day mortality and 1‐year mortality. Patients will be followed after 30 days and 1 year for activities of daily living and mortality assessment.

In both retrospective and prospective evaluations, transfusion has been associated with adverse, neutral, or protective effects. These varying results likely stem from a complex interplay between transfusion, patient characteristics, and clinical context. The objective was to test whether age, comorbidities, and clinical context modulate the effect of transfusion on survival.Methods: By using the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II database (v. 2.6), a retrospective analysis of 9,809 critically ill patients, we evaluated the effect of RBC transfusion on 30-day and 1-year mortality. Propensity score modeling and logistic regression adjusted for known confounding and assessed the independent effect of transfusion on 30-day and 1-year mortality. Sensitivity analysis was performed by using 3,164 transfused and non-transfused pairs, matched according the previously validated propensity model for RBC transfusion.Results: RBC transfusion did not affect 30-day or 1-year mortality in the overall cohort. Patients younger than 55 years had increased odds of mortality (OR, 1.71; P < 0.01) with transfusion. Patients older than 75 years had lower odds of 30-day and 1-year mortality (OR, 0.70; P < 0.01) with transfusion. Transfusion was associated with worse outcome among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR, 2.1; P < 0.01). The propensity-matched population corroborated findings identified by regression adjustment.Conclusion: A complex relation exists between RBC transfusion and clinical outcome. Our results show that transfusion is associated with improved outcomes in some cohorts and worse outcome in others, depending on comorbidities and patient characteristics.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively during the study period. The main outcome measures were whether or not patients were transfused with red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product, the proportion of patients returned to theatre for investigation for post-operative bleeding and length of stay in the intensive care unit. We performed univariate analysis to identify the factors influencing the outcome measures and multivariate analysis to identify the effect of administration of tranexamic acid on the outcome measures. Results: Administration of tranexamic acid was an independent factor affecting the transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product. It was also an independent factor influencing the rate of return to theatre for exploration of bleeding. The odds of receiving a transfusion or returning to theatre for bleeding were significantly lower in patients receiving tranexamic acid. The administration of tranexamic acid also significantly decreased blood loss. We did not find any association between the administration of tranexamic acid and the length of intensive care stay. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of 4191 patients who underwent a primary cardiac operation, administration of tranexamic acid decreased the number of patients exposed to a transfusion or returned to theatre for bleeding in our institute. © 2006 Vuylsteke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2006/08/30/,"BioMed Central Ltd., 34 - 42 Cleveland Street, W1T 4LB",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/700101662?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""700101662; 44420303"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""acetylsalicylic acid"", ""493-53-8"", ""50-78-2"", ""53663-74-4"", ""53664-49-6"", ""63781-77-1"", ""clopidogrel"", ""113665-84-2"", ""120202-66-6"", ""90055-48-4"", ""94188-84-8"", ""tranexamic acid"", ""1197-18-8"", ""701-54-2"", ""aspirin"", ""Embase"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""18:Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""logistic regression analysis"", ""postoperative hemorrhage -- prevention"", ""heart surgery"", ""postoperative hemorrhage -- therapy"", ""major clinical study"", ""postoperative hemorrhage -- drug therapy"", ""multivariate analysis"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- drug therapy"", ""cryoprecipitate"", ""tranexamic acid -- drug therapy"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""intensive care unit"", ""female"", ""human"", ""postoperative hemorrhage -- complication"", ""blood transfusion"", ""hospitalization"", ""aged"", ""coronary artery bypass graft"", ""outcomes research"", ""article"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""controlled study"", ""reoperation"", ""tranexamic acid -- intravenous drug administration"", ""heart valve replacement"", ""adult"", ""heart valve surgery"", ""practice guideline"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2253-6-9"", ""issn"": ""14712253"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Anaesthesia, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire CB3 8RE, United Kingdom alain.vuylsteke@papworth.nhsuk palanisara@doctors.org.uk Caroline.Gerrard@papworth.nhs.uk, Research and Development Department, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire CB3 8RE, United Kingdom fay.cafferty@cancer.org.uk, Department of Anaesthesia, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire CB3 8RE, United Kingdom, Vuylsteke, A., Department of Anaesthesia, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire CB3 8RE, United Kingdom"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2006-10-11"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-17"", ""Number of references - 32"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - BAMNB""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=BMC+Anesthesiology&rft.atitle=The+impact+of+administration+of+tranexamic+acid+in+reducing+the+use+of+red+blood+cells+and+other+blood+products+in+cardiac+surgery&rft.au=Vuylsteke%2C+Alain&rft.aulast=Vuylsteke&rft.aufirst=Alain&rft.date=2006-08-30&rft.volume=6&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=BMC+Anesthesiology&rft.issn=14712253&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F1471-2253-6-9"", ""date"": ""2006 Aug 30""}"

Methods: From 2003 to 2016, 79 patients underwent Fontan operation at IRCCS Policlinico San Donato. Unfavourable early outcome was defined by the presence of one or more of these occurrences: prolonged hospital stay >25 days, prolonged pleural effusion ≥14 days and prolonged inotropic support ≥72 h. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to detect the risk factors associated with early unfavourable outcome after Fontan completion. Results: Prolonged hospital stay >25 days was found in 24.05% of patients and its associated significant risk factors were low preoperative O2 saturation (p 0.007), Fontan fenestration (p 0.009) and plasma transfusion (p 0.030). Prolonged pleural effusion ≥14 days was found in 24.05% and no significant risk factors were detected. Prolonged inotropic support ≥72 h was found in 35.44% and significant risk factors were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (P 0.003), fenestration (P 0.023), plasma transfusion (P 0.028) and non staged Fontan (P 0.039). In multivariable analysis of combined unfavourable outcome, significant risk factors were fenestration (P 0.030) with some trends towards low preoperative O2 saturation (P 0.056). Conclusions: Unfavourable early outcome can occur following Fontan completion with associated prolonged hospital stay.

Study Design/Methods: In a regional health care system consisting of 11 hospitals using a common CPOE, data on the number of RBC orders and alerts that were generated were collected over a 4-month period. During this period, an on-screen alert was triggered if the antecedent Hb was >8 g/dl. The CPOE was then modified to require the prescriber to select one of the following pre-populated indications for the RBC transfusion: Hb ≤ 10 Patient with Acute Cardiac Ischemia; Hb ≤ 8.0 Non-ICU Patient with Anemia, Hb ≤ 7.5 Stable ICU patient; Acute Bleeding with BP Instability; Surgical Blood Loss Anticipated; and Other. An on-screen alert was generated when the recipient's most recent Hb value exceeded the corresponding Hb value for the selected indication; the alerts were thus “adapted” to the selected indication for transfusion. For the Other category an alert was generated if the antecedent Hb was > 8.0 g/dl. Six months of data postimplementation of the ordering criteria was collected. Results/Findings: In the 4-month period before the ordering criteria were implemented, 69.7% of the RBC orders generated an alert; in the 6-month period thereafter the alert rate was significantly lower at 49.1% (p < 0.0001). The % of heeded alerts increased during the adaptive alert period (10.8% versus 13.5%, respectively, p < 0.0001). “Other” was the most commonly selected transfusion indication (29.8%), followed by Hgb ≤ 8.0 Non-ICU Patient with Anemia (28.6%), and Hgb ≤ 7.5 Stable ICU Patient (20.3%). The other four RBC indications had significantly lower frequencies, each ≤7% of the total number of alerts. Of the all the orders placed, the Other category had the highest percentage of patients whose antecedent Hb value was above the threshold value (79.6%), followed by Hb ≤ 7.5 Stable ICU Patient (34.8%) and Hb ≤ 8.0 Non-ICU Patient with Anemia (28.2%). There was also variation between the RBC indication categories with respect to mean antecedent Hb levels. Patients on whom RBCs were ordered using the Surgical Blood Loss Anticipated category had the highest average antecedent Hb of 9.63 +/- 2.34g/dl, which is in line with the fact that these units were ordered preemptively and not in response to anemia. The indications with the lowest mean recipient antecedent Hb values were Hb ≤ 8.0 Non-ICU Patient with Anemia (7.71 +/- 1.10 g/dl) and Hb ≤ 7.5 Stable ICU Patients (7.39 +/- 1.22 g/dl).

Hematocrit (Hct) is red cell volume (RBCV)/BV and may not reflect RBCV if plasma volume (PV) is changing. Hypothesis: Information from BV analysis (BVA-100, Daxor, NY) may better guide fluid and red cell trx than information from PAC and Hct. Methods: Surgical patients with PAC and septic shock, severe sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and/or ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <150 on PEEP ≥10 cm H2O), were randomized into Control group (using PAC alone) or the BV group (using PAC + BVA). Treatment protocol and endpoints of resuscitation were used (1). BV was measured using I-131 labeled albumin to measure PV, and from lab Hct, RBCV was calculated. PV, RBVC and BV were presented as deviation from predicted values based on patients size. BV was obtained on days 1, 2, 3, 5-7 after resuscitation in both groups, but BV group was allowed additional BVA as needed during the ICU stay. The team was blinded to the BV results in the Control group. In the BV group, fluid/blood were titrated to reach a goal of 0-16% of predicted BV with RBCV less than -20% of predicted. Results: There were no differences in the Control (n=50) vs BV (n=50) group respectively in: Age 63±15 vs 61±17 yrs, Female:Male 18:32 vs 23:27, Septic shock/severe sepsis 34 vs 35, Cardiogenic shock 9 vs 6, ARDS 14 vs 21, Lactic acid 4.1±3.1 vs 4.0±2.8, APACHE II 26±2 vs 27±2. Treatment in first 7 days were assessed. Of 198 BV's done in the Control group, different treatment would be administered in the following way: 21 >fluids, 62 diuresed, 48 trx, and 25 no trx. Of the 225 BV's done in the BV group, treatment changed as follows: 45 >fluids, 51 diuresed, 25 trx, and 13 no trx. There were no statistical differences in PAC/ventilator days, ICU/hospital days.

Method: 1045 consecutive major arterial procedures, in the last 10 years, were classified into two groups: the Clopidogrel group consisted of 482 procedures performed under dual clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery; while the No Clopidogrel group consisted of 563 procedures completed on patients who were taking neither medication or were on aspirin alone. The primary composite end point was reoperation for bleeding and bleeding-related death. Secondary endpoints included blood transfusion requirements, hematoma formation, duration of the procedures as well as length of stay. Results: The first phase of the study, reporting on 647 arterial procedures by early 2012, was published in the J Vasc Surg 2013;58:1586-92. Patients on clopidogrel had a higher cardiovascular risk profile, and a higher prevalence of prior peripheral and coronary stents (P<.0001). Clopidogrel use (46%) was common across all operation categories. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary end point between the two groups (0.8% and 0.5% respectively, P=NS). Blood transfusions were mainly required by patients undergoing aortic surgery, at similar rates and volumes in both groups. The mean operative time and ICU/hospital lengths of stay were not longer in clopidogrel recipients.

The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence comparing the outcomes of off-pump with on-pump redo CABG. Methods: Studies were systematically searched and identified using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) by two researchers independently. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, post-operative complications, completeness of revascularization, blood transfusion rate, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital stays. Results: The 21 studies including 4,889 patients were enrolled in our meta-analysis. Compared with on-pump, the off-pump technique was associated with significantly reduced 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26-0.72, p = 0.001).

e148bff9-5146-4d6c-9b4c-0c8993ce14a2,Impact of delayed initiation of erythropoietin in critically ill patients,"['Duby, Jeremiah J.', 'Erstad, Brian L.', 'Abarca, Jacob', 'Camamo, James M.', 'Huckleberry, Yvonne', 'Bramblett, Stuart N.']",BMC Blood Disorders,7,,,"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) use for anemia of critical illness at a practice site where delayed initiation is common. Methods: Retrospective medical record review involving patients treated with rHuEPO for anemia of critical illness. Those patients given rHuEPO or diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) prior to ICU admission were excluded. The primary endpoints were rHuEPO use and RBC transfusion patterns. Results: Complete data were collected for consecutive admissions of 126 patients. Average age (SD) and APACHE II score were 56.5 (18.6) years and 25 (7.8), respectively. The median ICU (IQR) and hospital length of stay (LOS) were 24 (11.25, 39) and 29 (17, 44.75) days, respectively. Treatment with rHuEPO was started an average of 12.5 +/- 10.5 days after ICU admission and given for 3.8 +/- 3.8 doses. Eighty percent of patients were transfused with an average total of 5.42 +/- 5.08 units received. RBC exposure inversely correlated with a lower mean hemoglobin response to rHuEPO. ICU LOS (p < 0.0001), hemoglobin at 24 hours (p = 0.055), transfusion within 48 hours of admit (p < 0.0001), and postoperative status (p = 0.019) were the best predictors of transfusion requirements (r2 = 0.37). Conclusion: Delayed initiation of rHuEPO for anemia of critical illness resulted in comparable hemoglobin and transfusion benefits. Future studies are needed to establish clinical benefit and role in therapy. RBC exposure may blunt the erythropoietic effects of rHuEPO, potentially frustrating benefits to those of greatest apparent need. © 2007 Duby et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2007/10/04/,"BioMed Central Ltd., 34 - 42 Cleveland Street, W1T 4LB",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/704430115?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""704430115; 350142919"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""recombinant erythropoietin"", ""113427-24-0"", ""122312-54-3"", ""130455-76-4"", ""Embase"", ""17:Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""critically ill patient"", ""anemia -- drug therapy"", ""hospitalization"", ""therapy delay"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""major clinical study"", ""kidney failure"", ""article"", ""anemia -- therapy"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""medical record"", ""length of stay"", ""recombinant erythropoietin -- drug therapy"", ""intensive care unit"", ""adult"", ""human"", ""APACHE""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2326-7-1"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Inpatient Pharmacy Department, Kaiser Permanente, 975 Sereno Dr., Vallejo, CA 94589, United States dubyjj@yahoo.com, The University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science- Pulido, 1295 N.

The Transfusion and Anemia eXpertise Initiative (TAXI) recommendations seek to limit unnecessary and potentially harmful transfusions, but use has been variable. We sought to identify barriers and facilitators to using the TAXI recommendations to inform implementation efforts. Materials and Methods: The integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework guided semi-structured interviews conducted in 8 U.S. ICUs; 50 providers in multiple ICU roles completed interviews. Adapted Framework analysis, a form of content analysis, used the iPARIHS innovation, recipient, context and facilitation constructs and subconstructs to categorize data and identify patterns as well as unique informative statements. Results: Providers perceived that the TAXI recommendations would reduce transfusion rates and practice variability, but adoption faced challenges posed by attitudes around transfusion and care in busy and complex units. Development of widespread buy-in and inclusion in implementation, integration into workflow, designating committed champions, and monitoring outcomes data were expected to enhance implementation. Conclusions: Targeted activities to create buy-in, educate, and plan for use are necessary for TAXI implementation.

Methods A retrospective comparative study was conducted using hospital medical records from January 2013 till Oct 2016 in Women's Hospital, Doha, Qatar. A total of 67 women were diagnosed with abnormally invasive placenta previa during this time period- 33 women underwent prophylactic intravascular ballooning before caesarean section (study group) and 34 women underwent caesarean section without ballooning (control group). The outcome measures looked at were total estimated intraoperative blood loss, total units of blood transfused, loss in haemoglobin and hematocrit, total operative time, the necessity of other haemostatic medications and surgical procedures, the duration of hospital stay, neonatal outcomes like APGAR scores and admission to neonatal intensive care. Analysis was done using Student T test, Chi Square test and Fishers test as applicable. Results The demographics in both groups were comparable, with no significant difference noted in maternal age (P = 1), nationality (P = 0.86), BMI (P = 0.85), parity (P = 0.26), number of gestation (P = 0.31), pre op haemoglobin (P = 0.736) and other maternal co morbidities like anemia (P = 0.7), diabetes (P = 0.5) and hypertension (P = 0.08). There was significant difference in the gestational age at delivery with P = 0.015 (35 W+6 D versus 34 W+3 days). No significant difference was noted in the mean intra-operative blood loss (3115 ± 1745 versus 3447 ± 2352, P = 0.515), requirement of transfusion ≥6 units (30.3% versus 41.17%, P = 0.357), duration of hospital stay (6.18 ± 3.32 versus 5.61 ± 3.48, P = 0.495), loss in haemoglobin (2.158 ± 1.758 versus 1.68 ± 1.69, P = 0.26) and the use of other medications and surgical procedures. The use of general anesthesia was significantly more in the study group (OR 4.7 95% CI 1.61- 13.8, P = 0.049), with no difference in the neonatal apgar scores or frequency of NICU admissions. Conclusion The placement of internal iliac artery balloon catheter is an invasive procedure which consumes time and resources. Its value use as a means of reducing intra-operative blood loss in patients with abnormally invasive placenta is questionable, since evidence of any proof of overall benefit is limited.

Methods: Data of all patients who underwent 3D-TLPD (n = 202) or open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) (n = 213) at a single institution between October 2014 and December 2016 were reviewed. We evaluated the safety, feasibility, and oncologic outcomes of 3D-TLPD compared with OPD. Results: The mean operative times in the 3D-TLPD and OPD groups were comparable (P = 0.322). The estimated blood loss and perioperative transfusion rate were similar in both groups, as were the morbidity and mortality rates (P > 0.050). The mean number of analgesic administered and the mean length of hospital and intensive care unit stay were lower (P < 0.001) and shorter (P < 0.001, P = 0.009) in the 3D-TLPD group than in the OPD group, respectively. The surgical resection margins and the number of lymph nodes harvested did not differ between the 2 groups; however, a significant difference was observed in pathological results.

6dbcf97d-44bc-44d7-b7df-50c31d7579d0,Early Use of Vasopressors in the Resuscitation of Hemorrhagic Shock Due to Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"['Bahk, J.', 'Espinosa Hernandez, A.', 'Maher, P.J.']",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,207,1,,"RATIONALE: Although transfusion remains the cornerstone of treatment in traumatic hemorrhagic shock, recent data suggests a role for vasopressors in certain patients to reduce transfusion requirements and limit the duration of shock. Little is known about vasopressor use in early resuscitation of non-traumatic/medical hemorrhagic shock. Our study aimed to investigate benefits of early use of vasopressors in hemorrhagic shock due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on 72 patients hospitalized with hemorrhagic shock due to GIB in four Mount Sinai Hospitals identified using the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. Clinical characteristics of patients who received vasopressors within the first six hours of shock were compared to those who did not. The primary outcome of interest was time to resolution of shock by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary outcomes included mortality, volume of crystalloids and blood products at seven days. RESULTS:31 patients received vasopressors with 41 patients treated without vasopressors. The mean ages were 67.46 years for vasopressor patients and 72.95 without. Vasopressor patients included 29% males compared to 52% of those without vasopressors. Causes of GIB for both groups were similar with the majority being upper GIB (55.5% and 52.3%), followed by lower GIB and esophageal varices. Higher APACHE II and SOFA scores at 24 hours were seen in patients requiring vasopressors (20.89 vs 16.4 (p=0.002), 8.5 vs 5.66 (p=0.006), respectively). The receipt of anticoagulants at the time of shock were statistically similar. Patients placed on vasopressors were given more crystalloids in first 24 hours (1305ml vs 1018ml, p=0.03) and a greater proportion of these patients remained on ventilators at 48hours (55.6% vs 31.8%, p=0.048) compared to those not on vasopressors. More total crystalloids, packed red cells, and fresh frozen plasma were administered within the first seven days of shock (2766ml vs 1873ml, 3.93units vs 3.30units, 1.43units vs 0.57units, respectively, p<0.05). Neither ICU nor total length of stay was different between groups. Mortality was not statistically different between the groups on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Time to resolution of shock was longer in patients given vasopressors than those without vasopressors (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that vasopressors did not improve outcomes in patients with hemorrhagic shock from GIB. Possible explanations include refractory vasoplegic state leading to multiple organ failure or differences in illness severity not captured by our current analysis. Limitations include retrospective design and small sample size. A larger cohort study with propensity score matching is planned for further investigation.

A retrospective observational study was undertaken, and all consecutive pediatric heart surgeries over 1 year period were studied. Excessive post-operative bleeding was defined as 10 ml/kg/h of chest tube output for 1 h or 5 ml/kg/h for three consecutive hours in the first 12 h of pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) stay. Risk factors including demographics, complexity of cardiac defect, CPB parameters, hematological studies, and post-operative morbidity and mortality were evaluated for excessive bleeding. 253 patients were studied, and 107 (42 %) met the criteria for excessive bleeding. Bayesian model averaging revealed that greater volume of blood products transfusion during CPB was significantly associated with excessive bleeding. Multiple logistic regression analysis of blood products transfusion revealed that increased volume of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) administration for CPB prime and during CPB was significantly associated with excessive bleeding (p = 0.028 and p = 0.0012, respectively). Proportional odds logistic regression revealed that excessive bleeding was associated with greater time to achieve negative fluid balance, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and duration of PCICU stay (p < 0.001) after adjusting for multiple parameters. A greater volume of blood products administration, especially PRBCs transfusion for CPB prime, and during the CPB period is associated with excessive post-operative bleeding.

Guidelines regarding thromboprophylaxis in burn patients are unclear. This study aims to compare the outcomes of early versus late thromboprophylaxis initiation in burn patients. In this 3-year analysis of 2017–2019 ACS-TQIP, adult(18–64years) burn patients were identified after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria and stratified based on timing of initiation of VTE prophylaxis: Early(<24 hours of admission); Late(>24 hours). Outcomes were deep venous thrombosis(DVT), pulmonary embolism(PE), unplanned return to operating room (OR), unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, post-prophylaxis packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion, and mortality. Nine thousand two hundred and seventy-two patients were identified. Overall, median age was 41years, 71.5% were male, and median[IQR] injury severity score was 3[1–8]. 53% had second-degree burns, and 80% had less than 40% of total body surface area affected. Median time to thromboprophylaxis initiation was 11[6–20.6] hours. Overall VTE rate was 0.9% (DVT−0.7%, PE−0.2%). On univariable analysis, early prophylaxis group had lower rates of DVT(0.6% vs 1.1%, P = .025), and PE(0.1% vs 0.6%, P < .001). On multivariable regression, late prophylaxis was associated with 1.8 times higher odds of DVT (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.04–3.11, P = .03), 4.8 times higher odds of PE(aOR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.9–11.9, P < .001), and 2 times higher odds of unplanned ICU admission(aOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.4–3.1, P < .001). Furthermore, early thromboprophylaxis was not associated with increased odds of post-prophylaxis PRBC transfusion(aOR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.8–1.4, P = .4), and mortality(aOR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.4–1.1, P = .13).

96700a56-4fd8-43c5-bb36-9f461fe13718,Outcomes of endoscopic treatment of gastroduodenal Dieulafoy's lesion with rubber band ligation and thermal/injection therapy,"['Mumtaz, Rushda', 'Shaukat, Masud', 'Ramirez, Francisco C.']",Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology,36,4,310-314,"Background: Dieulafoy's lesion is a rare but important cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Current endoscopic methods used to treat Dieulafoy's lesion include injection, with or without thermal methods, and mechanical methods. The latter include variceal ligation and hemoclips. There are no studies comparing the outcomes of rubber band ligation and injection with or without thermal therapy. Aim: To report the outcomes of Dieulafoy's lesion treated endoscopically with rubber band ligation and injection with or without thermal therapy at a single institution. Methods: Patients with the diagnosis of Dieulafoy's lesion treated endoscopically at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, between August 1994 and August 2002 were analyzed. Demographic data, mode of presentation, risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemodynamic parameters, blood transfusion requirements, endoscopic findings, details of endoscopic therapy, length of stay in ICU/hospital, complications, recurrence of bleeding, and mortality rates were collected and compared between those receiving endoscopic band ligation (EBL group) and those receiving injection with or without thermal therapy (non-EBL group). Results: Twenty-three patients with Dieulafoy's lesion (14 in the EBL group and nine in the non-EBL group) were studied. All patients were men. The mean age, hemoglobin levels on admission, and the transfusion requirements before therapy were similar in both groups. Fourteen patients (eight in the EBL- and six in the non-EBL groups) presented with hematemesis and the remaining with melena. The majority of Dieulafoy's lesions (91.3%) were located in the stomach and two in the duodenum. Active bleeding at the time of endoscopy was seen in 61% of cases, and immediate hemostasis was achieved with either method in 100% of patients.

Autologous priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit at the initiation of bypass partially replaces the priming solution with autologous blood. We examined the efficacy of autologous priming of the circuit in reducing blood transfusion. METHODS: One hundred and four patients were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass was with or without autologous priming. RESULTS: With autologous priming, a mean volume of 808.8 +/‐ 159.3 mL of priming solution was replaced with autologous blood. This allowed a higher hematocrit value on admission to the intensive care unit and at discharge from hospital. In all, 49% of the control group required a blood transfusion compared with 17% from the autologous priming group (p = 0.0007). The mean volume of blood transfused was 277.6 +/‐ 363.8 mL in the control group compared with 70.1 +/‐ 173.5 mL in the autologous priming group (p = 0.0005).

97a71d4c-d64b-41a3-bc5a-5526968545ca,Toward a better definition of massive transfusion: Focus on the interval of hemorrhage control,"['Sharpe, John P.', 'Weinberg, Jordan A.', 'Magnotti, Louis J.', 'Croce, Martin A.', 'Fabian, Timothy C.']",Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,73,6,1553-1557,"BACKGROUND: In clinical research, massive transfusion (MT) is commonly defined as transfusion of 10 or more red blood cell (RBC) units within 24 hours. However, the clinical relevance of this definition remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated whether patients who reach the MT threshold during hemorrhage control differ clinically from those who reach it after hemorrhage control (i.e., after intensive care unit [ICU] arrival) but before 24 hours. METHODS: Prospective data were collected on all Level I trauma resuscitations within 5.5 years. Patients transfused 10 or more RBCs in the first 24 hours of hospitalization were identified and stratified according to when the MT threshold was achieved: before ICU arrival (Pre-ICU) versus after ICU arrival but before 24 hours of hospitalization (Post-ICU). Clinical characteristics between groups were compared. RESULTS: Three hundred five patients received 10 or more units before ICU arrival, and 46 reached the MT threshold after ICU arrival but before 24 hours. Both groups were clinically similar with respect to age, sex, and Injury Severity Score, but the Post-ICU group had a larger proportion of blunt injuries (71 vs. 53%, p < 0.05), lower mean admission lactate (5.9 vs. 8.1 mmol/L, p < 0.05), and higher systolic blood pressure (112 vs. 96 mm Hg, p < 0.05) compared with the Pre-ICU group. Twenty-four-hour mortality was significantly lower in the Post-ICU group compared with the Pre-ICU group (9 vs. 33%, p < 0.05). In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between groups (33 vs. 46%, p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Patients reaching the MT threshold after ICU arrival comprise a relatively small proportion of those that would be included by the traditional MT definition. However, they have a significantly decreased mortality risk at 24 hours and the potential to dilute the study cohort. For research purposes, restricting the MT definition to 10 or more RBCs during hemorrhage control may result in study cohorts with relatively more uniform mortality risks.

However, the triggers for MTP activation vary among institutions. One of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict massive transfusion (MT) is the assessment of blood consumption (ABC) score. The authors’ institution has used a simple clinical criterion, the Class-4 Hemorrhage Unresponsive to Lactated Ringer’s (CHULA criteria), as a trigger for MTP activation. Objective: To identify the accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation in trauma patients. Materials and Methods: Between April 2013 and April 2016, the authors retrospectively collected the data of trauma patients receiving blood transfusion in the first 24 hours at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, including demographic data, trauma scores, amount of blood transfusion, and mortality. The detail of CHULA criteria included 1) a patient with clinical signs of Class-4 hemorrhage, 2) not responding to one to two liters of Lactated Ringer’s bolus, and 3) had suspected ongoing bleeding. MT was defined as 1) packed red blood cells (PRC) transfusion of equal to or greater than 10 units in 24 hours, or 2) PRC transfusion of more than four units in the first hour. The accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation was analyzed. Comparison between CHULA criteria and ABC score (of equal to or greater than 2) was also performed. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight patients were included in the present study, 292 males and 66 females. The mechanisms of injury were 68% blunt and 32% penetrating, with an average injury severity score of 21. MTP was activated by CHULA criteria in 100 patients and 73 received MT. Of the 258 patients who did not meet CHULA criteria, five received MT. As a trigger for MT activation, CHULA criteria had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.6%, 90.4%, and 91%, respectively; while ABC score had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 62.8%, 78.9%, and 75.4%, respectively. Conclusion: CHULA criteria can predict MT in trauma patients with 91% accuracy.

This retrospective study investigates the differences in patterns of injury and factors affecting the mortality rate in 324 patients coming to Damascus Hospital with penetrating abdominal trauma, and illustrates the difficulties of diagnosis and decision making in crisis situations. Methods A retrospective study was registered from patient's records between October 2012 and June 2013 in Damascus Hospital. All victims were injured either by explosions or gunshots. Results A total of 325 patients: 183 by explosion; 56.3%, 141 by gunshot; 43.3%, and one patient by other means; 0.3% were reviewed. The study focused on the two large groups with a total of 324 patients. Males were predominant (82.1%; n = 266) and the majority of patients were between 19 and 35 years old. Patients suffering from multi abdominal organ injury were more common in gunshot group (n = 72, 51.1%) compared to the explosion group (n = 83, 45.3%). 264 patients (81.5%) underwent surgical operations and only 22 (8.3%) had normal laparotomy. The inpatient mortality rate was (17.0%; n = 55), and there was no difference in mortality rate between the two groups. More than the half of deaths (n = 42; 76.4%) had a P.A.T.I score ≥ 25 where the death rate was 35.6% which is higher compared to 6.3% in those with a P.A.T.I < 25. In the ICU 33 patients died, of these (87.9%; n = 29) died after immediate admission to the ICU which is higher compared with a later admission (12.1%; n = 4). The need for massive blood transfusion affected the mortality rate. Conclusion Efforts must be directed toward training of medical staff to deal with crisis incidents.

Remifentanil and fentanyl are strong opioids widely used intraoperatively due to their potency and pharmacokinetic properties. We designed a study to evaluate associations between these opioids and critical care and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC. Methods: A historical cohort of patients taken to CRS-HIPEC from 2007 to 2020 at a university hospital in Bogota, Colombia was analyzed retrospectively. We compared outcomes of patients who received intraoperative remifentanil (group R) or fentanyl (group F). Primary outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes were total LOS, ICU readmission, inpatient mortality, time vented, need for tracheostomy, time to ambulation and oral feeds, need for transfusion, estimated blood loss, intraoperative crystalloids, and units of red blood cells and plasma transfused in surgery. We excluded patients with incomplete medical records or whose procedure was palliative. Results: A total of 173 patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 52 ± 11.4 years and female sex was preponderant (73%). 75 patients (43%) received intraoperative remifentanil and 98 (57%) fentanyl. Group R was associated with a shorter ICU stay (mean 5.9 days vs. 6.4 days in group F, p < 0.018). There were also statistically significant associations regarding days until extubation (Group R 3.1 vs 3.7 Group F, p < 0.01), need for transfusion, and estimated blood loss (Table 1). Conclusions: Our results suggest an association of remifentanil and shorter ICU LOS and earlier extubation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of TXA when used as topical soaked sponges (tTXA) on peri-operative blood loss and changes in hemoglobin following posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for neuromuscular and syndromic scoliosis (NMS). METHODS: A single center review of NMS patients who underwent PSF was conducted. The initial set of patients where no tTXA (control) was used were compared to consecutive NMS patients in whom tTXA was used. In the tTXA group, sponges soaked in 1g TXA in 500 mL normal saline were packed in the wound instead of dry sponges. Estimated blood loss (EBL) was calculated intraoperatively using a standard way. Pre-operative, intra-operative and immediate post-operative variables were collected and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: 33 patients were included (mean age- 13.5 yrs., BMI- 21, 17 patients in tTXA and 16 patients in control group). Pre-op demographic and radiographic variables were similar between the 2 groups. EBL, EBL per level, EBVL, operative time and number of levels fused were similar in both groups. tTXA group received less intra-operative pRBC transfusion as compared to the control group (150 ± 214 vs 363 ± 186 cc, P = .004). No difference was noted in post-op blood transfusion and drain output for 3 days in both the groups. tTXA group had lesser hospital (5.1 vs 8.9 days) and ICU length of stay (2 vs 4.2 days) and fewer immediate post-operative complications (23.5 vs 52.9%) compared to the control group but not statistically significant (P > .05).

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often treated with steroids, require intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, and may therefore be at risk for HCMV infection. However, which factors predispose severely ill patients with COVID-19 to HCMV infection and the prognostic value of such infections remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to examine the incidence and potential risk factors of HCMV infection in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and evaluate the relationship between HCMV infection and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used administrative claims data from advanced treatment hospitals in Japan to identify and analyze patients with severe or critical COVID-19. We explored potential risk factors for HCMV infection using multivariable regression models and its contribution to mortality in patients with COVID-19. Overall, 33,151 patients who progressed to severe or critical COVID-19 illness were identified. The incidence of HCMV infection was 0.3-1.7 % depending on the definition of HCMV infection. Steroids, immunosuppressants, ICU admission, and blood transfusion were strongly associated with HCMV infection. Furthermore, HCMV infection was associated with patient mortality independent of the observed risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: HCMV infection is a notable complication in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 who are admitted to the ICU or receive steroids, immunosuppressants, and blood transfusion and can significantly increase mortality risk.",2024,Netherlands,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2024.06.015,"{""pmid"": 38944381, ""electronic_issn"": ""1437-7780"", ""linking_issn"": ""1341-321X"", ""nlm_status"": ""Publisher"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9608375"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""Administrative claims database"", ""COVID-2019"", ""Cytomegalovirus"", ""Risk factors""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""aheadofprint"", ""publication_date"": ""2024 Jun 27"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2024-01-26"", ""accepted"": ""2024-06-21"", ""published"": ""2024-06-30"", ""revised"": ""2024-05-07"", ""electronic"": ""2024-06-27""}}"

Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of pts who develop IC as outpts and in the hospital setting. Methods: Records of IC from Jan 2007-2013 were reviewed. The study was conducted in 2 hospitals after IRB approval. Demographic details, clinical/lab features, imaging, endoscopy & histology, co-morbidities, concomitant medication, surgery, length of hospital stay & death <30 days of admission. were studied. The pts were divided into 2 gps; outpt (OP) onset, Gp A & inpt onset (IP), Gp B. The diagnosis of IC was made based on clinical features consistent with IC with -ve stool studies for infections & at least one diagnostic study consistent with IC (CT scan, colonoscopy, or histology). Exclusion criteria: age <18, pregnancy, +ve studies for gut pathogens, colonic ischemia due to trauma/ mechanical causes, chronic bowel ischemia, acute flare of IBD & evidence of diverticulitis. Results: A total of 118 IC pts were included (mean age 69.4), 98 females (83 %). 107 (90.7%) in Gp A and 11 in Gp B (9.3%). Gp B pts were older (78.4 vs 68.1, P=0.006) with lower body mass index (BMI=23.8 vs 28.5, P= 0.05). Clinical features were not different between the groups except for nausea, common in Gp A (40.2% vs 0%, P=0.007). Diastolic BP was lower in Gp B (60.5 vs 71.7, P=0.037). WBC and lactic acid levels were higher in Gp B (16.2 vs 12.7, P=0.028; & 17.8 vs 2.3, P= 0.0109), albumin level was lower in Gp B (2.9 vs 3.7, P=0.003). Radiologic findings were not different between the groups except free intra-abdominal fluid which was frequent in Gp B (50% vs 14.6%, P=0.025). Although the mean hospital stay was longer in Gp B (15 vs 5.6, P<0.0001) and blood transfusion was higher (54.5% vs 16.8%, P=0.008), need for ICU, ventilation, surgery & 30 day all-cause mortality did not reach significance between the groups. While constipation (15% in Gp A vs 0% in Gp B) & drug/vasculitis (5.6% vs 0% ) were the most direct identifiable predisposing factors in Gp A, however hypotension (3.7% in Gp A vs. 27.3% in Gp B) & a. fib (7.5% vs. 27.3%) were in Gp B (P=0.002). There was no difference between the groups in terms of comorbidities, medications use, location & colonoscopy features of IC. Conclusion: IP IC occurred in 9.3% of pts. who tend to be older with lower BMI and hypoalbuminemia. Their hospital course was prolonged & required more blood transfusion. Hypotension and atrial fibrillation as direct predisposing factors were more often in IP IC.

Lea+ screen cells are not mandatory and anti-Lea reactivities not detected in IAT are often ignored. Case report: The patient was a 59 year old russian of jewish descent with a diagnosis of CLL. His blood group was A RhD+. He had a moderate auto-immune haemolytic anemia and required regular blood transfusions. He was DAT positive with IgG and C3d and had a negative antibody screen until three months before the reaction. At this stage, a cold agglutinin as well as an anti-Lea reactivity was identified. Despite negative cross-matches in IAT gel, the patient unexpectedly mounted a severe transfusion reaction against one RBC unit. The reaction was characterized by anxiety, shortage of breath, fever, shivering, chest and lower back pain. At the ICU, the patient developed hematuria, DIC, renal dysfunction and a minor cardiac infarction. He recovered without sequelae and was discharged from the hospital three days after the reaction. The unit to which he reacted was Lea+. In further transfusions, Lea- units were selected for cross-matching and were all negative in tubes at 37°C. No further reactions have been observed. Methods: Pretransfusion testing was performed using microcolumn techniques in the Ortho AutoVue system and with DiaMed gel cards. Antibody investigations were done in IAT gel, PEG/IAT, direct agglutination in tubes and against enzyme-treated cells using in-house and commercial RBC panels. The monocyte monolayer assay (MMA) was performed as previously described, using RBC from the unit causing the reaction as well as Lea+ and Lea- test cells. Results: An alloantibody of the IgM type against Lea active at 37°C was identified in the patient. It was only detected using a direct agglutination test and not in IAT gel. The post reaction investigation confirmed lack of reactivity in IAT gel against the transfused red cells, but showed positive agglutination in direct test in tubes at 37°C; a reaction that was inhibited by soluble Lea. In addition, the patient's serum triggered a strongly positive MMA test against the transfused Lea+ RBC and against Lea+ test cells, but not against several Lea- cells, supporting a role for this anti-Lea antibody in the transfusion reaction. Summary: We propose that this transfusion reaction was caused by an unusual anti-Lea antibody of the IgM type active at 37°C. It escaped detection because it did not agglutinate donor Lea+ RBC in the IAT gel cards used for pretransfusion testing. Why an alloantibody that is normally clinically insignificant may be active in vivo in rare cases remains to be elucidated.",2010/07//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013221683?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013221683; 70237939"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""low back pain"", ""heart infarction"", ""case report"", ""fever"", ""transfusion"", ""thorax"", ""society"", ""donor"", ""shivering"", ""patient"", ""blood group"", ""hospital"", ""agglutination test"", ""enzyme"", ""blood transfusion"", ""immunoglobulin G"", ""antibody"", ""immunoglobulin M"", ""breathing"", ""cold agglutinin"", ""alloantibody"", ""diagnosis"", ""blood transfusion reaction"", ""anemia"", ""erythrocyte"", ""anxiety"", ""tube"", ""hematuria"", ""assay"", ""antigen antibody reaction"", ""monocyte"", ""serum""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1423-0410.2010.01343-2.x"", ""issn"": ""00429007"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden , Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden , Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, Höglund, P., Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 31st International Congress of the International Society of Blood Transfusion in Joint Cooperation with the 43rd Congress of the DGTI"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2010-08-13"", ""Date revised - 2010-08-18"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.atitle=A+severe+haemolytic+transfusion+reaction+caused+by+anti-Lea+of+IGM+type&rft.au=H%C3%B6glund%2C+P.&rft.aulast=H%C3%B6glund&rft.aufirst=P.&rft.date=2010-07-01&rft.volume=99&rft.issue=&rft.spage=456&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.issn=00429007&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fj.1423-0410.2010.01343-2.x"", ""date"": ""Jul 2010""}"

STUDY DESIGN: At 113 days' gestation, systemic hypotension (mean blood pressure <30 mm Hg) was induced by withdrawing approximately 35% of the fetoplacental blood volume in the hemorrhage group (n = 6), whereas in the control group (n = 4) isovolemic exchange transfusion was carried out. Six days after the insult, fetal brains were removed and processed for histologic analysis. RESULTS: Five of the 6 fetuses in the hemorrhage group exhibited periventricular white-matter lesions, consisting of nodular coagulation necrosis or diffuse axonal swellings or both. No abnormal findings other than these lesions were detected in the fetal brains in either experimental group.

We focus on four subsets of critically ill patients: pediatric patients, patients with gastrointestinal bleeds, septic patients and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: Almost a decade after the TRICC trial, a randomized trial showing the safety of a restrictive transfusion threshold in critically ill patients, four large randomized controlled trials have shown that a restrictive transfusion strategy is safe in pediatric critically ill patients, patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeds, patients with septic shock and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A large multicenter randomized trial is underway to determine the safety of a restrictive strategy in myocardial infarction. SUMMARY: A restrictive transfusion threshold is recommended in nearly all critically ill patients. This is at least noninferior to more liberal transfusion practice; in addition, a restrictive threshold has shown improved outcomes in some patients and decreased chances of adverse events in patients. Judicious use of red cells improves patient outcome and protects the blood supply, a limited resource.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cost‐effectiveness of the use of CryoSeal®, an allogeneic single‐donor fibrin sealant, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: This randomized clinical study involved seven cardiac surgery centres in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing elective isolated CABG with the use of at least one internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft were assigned randomly to receive either CryoSeal® (5 ml per ITA bed) or no CryoSeal®. Primary efficacy endpoints were units of transfused red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates, and duration of intensive care unit stay. Secondary efficacy endpoints were 48‐h blood loss, reoperation for bleeding, mediastinitis, 30‐day mortality and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Between March 2009 and January 2012, 1445 patients were randomized. The intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population comprised 1436 patients; the per‐protocol (PP) population 1292. In both the ITT and the PP analysis, no significant difference between the treatment groups was observed for any of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition, no significant difference between the groups was seen in the proportion of transfused patients. Estimated CryoSeal® costs were €822 (95 per cent c.i. €808 to €836) per patient, which translated to €72,000 per avoided transfusion (unbounded 95 per cent c.i.). CONCLUSION: The use of the fibrin sealant CryoSeal® did not result in health benefits. Combined with the high cost per avoided transfusion, this study does not support the implementation of routine CryoSeal® use in elective isolated CABG.

However, the choice of initial resuscitation fluid, including the role of plasma, is unclear for patients after isolated traumatic brain injury. Methods We reviewed adult trauma patients admitted from January 2011 to July 2015 with isolated traumatic brain injury. “Early plasma” was defined as transfusion of plasma within 4 hours.

The aims of this study were to define the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to assess whether early prophylactic anticoagulation by LMWH postoperatively was indeed effective in reducing VTE without increasing risk of complications after MICS. METHODS: This investigation was a single-center, retrospective, propensity score-matched analysis study. A total of 473 patients underwent MICS, of whom 257 received prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH (LMWH group) in the early postoperative period and 216 were not treated with LMWH (Control group). The main outcome measurements included the incidence of embolism events and major bleeding events, the volume of erythrocyte transfusion, the volume of drainage and the duration of drainage after MICS. In addition, the incidence of poor wound healing, the mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time and postoperative hospitalization time were also documented. RESULTS: There were fewer embolic events (P=1.000) and a higher rate of major bleeding events (P=0.008) in the LMWH group than the Control group, and their magnitude and significance were maintained in the propensity matched analysis. In the matched cohorts, there was no significant difference in the total volume of red blood cell transfusion (P=0.552), assisted mechanical ventilation time (P=0.542), and the ICU stay time (P=0.166) between the two groups; while the volume of drainage (P<0.001) and the duration of drainage (P<0.001) in the LMWH group were significantly more than the Control group, and the incidence of poor wound healing (P=0.009) and the postoperative hospitalization time (P<0.001) were significantly increased in the LMWH group.

Study Design: This retrospective cohort analysis of a multicenter database included women admitted to labor and delivery from January 2015 to June 2018. A novel nursing assessment developed by Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses was used to categorize patients as low, medium or high risk for hemorrhage. This was implemented 6/1/2016 across the centers. Perinatal outcomes related to blood transfusion, estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥ 1000cc, ICU admission, chorioamnionitis, general anesthesia, oxytocin use and cesarean delivery were evaluated before and after implementation. Results: There were a total of 109,719 women included, with 38,751 women included prior to implementation of the hemorrhage risk assessment and 70,968 women after implementation.

It is unknown whether coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass and with exclusive use of arterial grafts (arterial off-pump CABG) offers any significant short-term advantages over standard CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. Accordingly, we performed a comparison of the short-term outcomes of arterial off-pump and standard CABG patients matched for preoperative risk and number of grafts. Methods. We studied 90 consecutive arterial off-pump CABG patients during a 2-year period, obtained demographic and clinical features and surgical characteristics, and calculated their predicted surgical risk (EuroSCORE). Using a database of 750 contemporaneous patients treated with standard CABG, we created a matched cohort of 90 patients using an iterative process prioritizing number of grafts, target vessels, EuroSCORE, age, and sex. We compared the two groups for baseline features and short-term clinical outcomes. Results. There were no differences in age (65.9 versus 64.7 years), sex, EuroSCORE (3.3 versus 3. 6), number of grafts (2.1 versus 2.1), and preoperative left ventricular function. Arterial off-pump CABG, however, was associated with decreased duration of operation (213 versus 252 minutes; p < 0.0013), decreased peak postoperative troponin I levels (mean, 10.8 versus 29.1 ng/mL; p < 0.0001), decreased peak norepinephrine dose (2.3 versus 4.1 μg/ min; p < 0.0082), and decreased likelihood of receiving red blood cell transfusion (17.8% versus 40%; p = 0.0016). There were no differences in duration of intensive care unit or hospital stay, incidence of atrial fibrillation, or other clinical complications. There was one death in each group. Conclusions. After matching for number of grafts and other important preoperative risk markers, arterial off-pump CABG still decreases the need for red blood cell transfusion and offers other moderate clinical advantages compared with standard on-pump CABG. © 2003 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",2003/01/01/,"Elsevier USA, 6277 Sea Harbor Drive, FL 32862 8239",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/694891480?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""694891480; 36099023"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""noradrenalin"", ""1407-84-7"", ""51-41-2"", ""troponin I"", ""77108-40-8"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""9:Surgery"", ""heart left ventricle function"", ""surgical risk"", ""major clinical study"", ""aged"", ""postoperative period"", ""coronary artery bypass graft"", ""treatment outcome"", ""article"", ""operation duration"", ""artery graft"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""coronary artery surgery"", ""priority journal"", ""troponin I -- endogenous compound"", ""female"", ""human"", ""male"", ""intermethod comparison""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-4975(02)04116-4"", ""issn"": ""00034975"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Dept. of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin/Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic., Australia , Dept. of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin/Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic., Australia, Department of Intensive Care, Austin/Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic. 3084, Australia rinaldo.bellomo@armc.org.au, Dept. of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin/Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic., Australia, Bellomo, R., Department of Intensive Care, Austin/Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic. 3084, Australia"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2003-01-28"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-19"", ""Number of references - 27"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - ATHSA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Annals+of+Thoracic+Surgery&rft.atitle=On-pump+coronary+artery+surgery+versus+off-pump+exclusive+arterial+coronary+grafting%3A+A+matched+cohort+comparison&rft.au=Haase%2C+Michael&rft.aulast=Haase&rft.aufirst=Michael&rft.date=2003-01-01&rft.volume=75&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=62&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Annals+of+Thoracic+Surgery&rft.issn=00034975&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2FS0003-4975%2802%2904116-4"", ""date"": ""2003 Jan 01""}"
bc6288ec-f5bc-4d50-9dfb-83317a957a17,Outcomes following a clinical algorithm allowing for delayed hysterectomy in the management of severe placenta accreta spectrum,"['Zuckerwise, Lisa C.', 'Craig, Amanda M.', 'Newton, JM.', 'Zhao, Shillin', 'Bennett, Kelly A.', 'Crispens, Marta A.']",American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,222,2,179.e1-179.e9,"Background: The incidence of placenta accreta spectrum is rising. Management is most commonly with cesarean hysterectomy. These deliveries often are complicated by massive hemorrhage, urinary tract injury, and admission to the intensive care unit. Up to 60% of patients require transfusion of ≥4 units of packed red blood cells. There is also a significant risk of death of up to 7%. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of patients with antenatal diagnosis of placenta percreta that was managed with delayed hysterectomy as compared with those patients who underwent immediate cesarean hysterectomy. Study Design: We performed a retrospective study of all patients with an antepartum diagnosis of placenta percreta at our large academic institution from January 1, 2012, to May 30, 2018. Patients were treated according to standard clinical practice that included scheduled cesarean delivery at 34–35 weeks gestation and intraoperative multidisciplinary decision-making regarding immediate vs delayed hysterectomy. In cases of delayed hysterectomy, the hysterotomy for cesarean birth used a fetal surgery technique to minimize blood loss, with a plan for hysterectomy 4–6 weeks after delivery. We collected data regarding demographics, maternal comorbidities, time to interval hysterectomy, blood loss, need for transfusion, occurrence of urinary tract injury and other maternal complications, and maternal and fetal mortality rates. Descriptive statistics were performed, and Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-square tests were used as appropriate. Results: We identified 49 patients with an antepartum diagnosis of placenta percreta who were treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center during the specified period. Of these patients, 34 were confirmed to have severe placenta accreta spectrum, defined as increta or percreta at the time of delivery. Delayed hysterectomy was performed in 14 patients: 9 as scheduled and 5 before the scheduled date. Immediate cesarean hysterectomy was completed in 20 patients: 16 because of intraoperative assessment of resectability and 4 because of preoperative or intraoperative bleeding. The median (interquartile range) estimated blood loss at delayed hysterectomy of 750 mL (650–1450 mL) and the sum total for delivery and delayed hysterectomy of 1300 mL (70 –2150 mL) were significantly lower than the estimated blood loss at immediate hysterectomy of 3000 mL (2375–4250 mL; P<.01 and P=.037, respectively). The median (interquartile range) units of packed red blood cells that were transfused at delayed hysterectomy was 0 (0–2 units), which was significantly lower than units transfused at immediate cesarean hysterectomy (4 units [2–8.25 units]; P<.01). Nine of 20 patients (45%) required transfusion of ≥4 units of red blood cells at immediate cesarean hysterectomy, whereas only 2 of 14 patients (14.2%) required transfusion of ≥4 units of red blood cells at the time of delayed hysterectomy (P=.016). There was 1 maternal death in each group, which were incidences of 7% and 5% in the delayed and immediate hysterectomy patients, respectively. Conclusion: Delayed hysterectomy may represent a strategy for minimizing the degree of hemorrhage and need for massive blood transfusion in patients with an antenatal diagnosis of placenta percreta by allowing time for uterine blood flow to decrease and for the placenta to regress from surrounding structures.",2020/02//,Mosby Inc.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2309895237?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2309895237; 2003395959"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""delayed hysterectomy"", ""placenta accreta spectrum"", ""placenta increta"", ""placenta percreta"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""10:Obstetrics and Gynecology"", ""clinical assessment"", ""placenta accreta -- diagnosis"", ""therapy delay"", ""Article"", ""hysterectomy"", ""patient care"", ""clinical article"", ""controlled study"", ""clinical outcome"", ""priority journal"", ""female"", ""prenatal diagnosis"", ""disease severity"", ""human"", ""placenta accreta -- surgery"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2019.08.035"", ""issn"": ""00029378"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States lisa.zuckerwise@vumc.org, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States , Department of Biostatistics, Nashville, TN, United States, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States , Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Nashville, TN, United States , Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States, Zuckerwise, Lisa C., Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2020-02-13"", ""Date revised - 2020-02-13"", ""Number of references - 20"", ""Last updated - 2020-02-13"", ""CODEN - AJOGA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=American+Journal+of+Obstetrics+and+Gynecology&rft.atitle=Outcomes+following+a+clinical+algorithm+allowing+for+delayed+hysterectomy+in+the+management+of+severe+placenta+accreta+spectrum&rft.au=Zuckerwise%2C+Lisa+C.&rft.aulast=Zuckerwise&rft.aufirst=Lisa&rft.date=2020-02-01&rft.volume=222&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=179.e1&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=American+Journal+of+Obstetrics+and+Gynecology&rft.issn=00029378&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ajog.2019.08.035"", ""date"": ""Feb 2020""}"

Thus, researchers have questioned whether blood from young donors is superior to blood from older donors. Blood transfusion is a key supportive therapy for trauma patients, and recent studies have reported the influence of blood donor age on recipient patient prognosis. Although some retrospective results found that blood from young donors improves survival, no influence of blood donor age was observed on outcomes in other study groups. The reasons for this discrepancy are complicated, but the fact that data were not obtained from randomized controlled trial (RCT) data should be considered. The current protocol and analysis method provide a feasible RCT design to evaluate the prognosis of severely ill surgery patients who were transfused with blood products from blood donors of different ages. METHODS: The current study is a pragmatic multicenter RCT (open, parallel-group, non-masked, superiority trial). Recruited surgery intensive care unit patients will be randomized into three groups and transfused with blood products from male donors of different ages (< 25, 25-45, and > 45 years). Survival time will be measured within 28 days. The survival characteristics, possible interaction between variables, and potential factors associated with death will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, two-way ANOVA, and Cox proportional hazards model, respectively.

However, strict RBC transfusion recommendations recently have been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the short- and long-term mortality outcomes after RBC transfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Design: This was a retrospective medical record review. Setting: Tertiary care academic medical center. Participants: The study included patients who underwent CABG from June 2006 to May 2013. Intervention: Adult (>18 years) cardiac surgery patients who were admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit in a tertiary care academic medical center from June 2006 to May 2013 were collected. In all, 2,180 patients who underwent CABG surgery were included into propensity-score matching analyses, which were matched 1:1. Patients who did not receive transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) (n = 937) were compared with those who received 1 to 5 U (n = 1,113). The study outcomes included mortality rates at 1, 3, and 6 months (short-term) and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years (long-term). Results: No statistical significant differences were found for the 1-month (2% v 1.1%, p = 0.292), 3-month (2.9% v 2%, p = 0.396), or 6-month mortality rate (4.3% v 3.4%, p = 0.602) in 446 patients with 1 to 5 U versus 446 matched patients with no PRBC transfusion. Patients in the transfused group compared with those in the no-transfusion group had statistically significant higher 3-year mortality rate (11% v 6.7%; hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.63; p = 0.038). Conclusion: In the present study, patients undergoing CABG surgery and receiving <6 U of PRBC did not have statistically increased risk for in-hospital mortality and up to 2 years postoperatively.

46fa519f-c7d4-4635-ada0-152a38487fb7,Association between Platelet Transfusion and Delirium in Critically Ill Children,"['Nelligan, Matthew', 'Nellis, Marianne E.', 'Mauer, Elizabeth A.', 'Gerber, Linda M.', 'Traube, Chani']",Children,10,5,,"Delirium is a frequent, serious, and preventable complication in critically ill children. Inflammation has been implicated as a mechanism for the development of delirium. Platelet transfusions may potentiate the body’s pro-inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that receipt of platelets would be associated with delirium development in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We performed a single-center retrospective cohort analysis including children admitted to the PICU between 2014 and 2018 who were transfused platelets within the first 14 days of admission. Data obtained included severity of illness, level of respiratory support, exposure to medications and blood products, as well as daily cognitive status. To account for time-dependent confounding, a marginal structural model (MSM) was constructed to delineate the relationship between platelet transfusion and next-day delirium. MSM demonstrated a 75% increase in the development of next-day delirium after transfusion of platelets (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.03–2.97). For every 1 cc/kg of platelet transfused, odds of next-day delirium increased by 9% (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.51). We reported an independent association between platelet transfusion and next-day delirium/coma after accounting for time-dependent confounders, with a dose–response effect.

Occurrence of AKI in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is associated with increased mortality and higher costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate occurrences of moderate or severe AKI among patients admitted to the ICU after liver transplantation and investigate characteristics associated with this complication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center retrospective cohort study in a public hospital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. METHODS: Forty-nine patients admitted to the ICU between January 2015 and April 2017 were included. AKI was defined from a modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) score (i.e. based exclusively on serum creatinine levels). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (36.7%) developed AKI KDIGO 2 or 3; mostly KDIGO 3 (16 out of the 18 patients). Lactate level within the first six hours after ICU admission (odds ratio, OR: 1.3; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.021-1.717; P = 0.034) and blood transfusion requirement within the first week following transplantation (OR: 8.4; 95% CI: 1.687-41.824; P = 0.009) were independently associated with development of AKI. Patients with AKI KDIGO 2 or 3 underwent more renal replacement therapy (72.2% versus 3.2%; P < 0.01), had longer hospital stay (20 days versus 15 days; P = 0.001), higher in-hospital mortality (44.4% versus 6.5%; P < 0.01) and higher mortality rate after one year (44.4% versus 9.7%; P = 0.01).

Methods: Doppler parameters of three sonograms (day before, first day after and 1 week after laser surgery for TTTS) were assessed for correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome at two years (2008-2016). NDI was defined as: cerebral palsy, deafness, blindness, and/or a Bayley-III cognitive/motor developmental test-score > 2SD below the mean. Results: Long-term outcome was assessed in 492 TTTS survivors. NDI was present in 5% (24/492).

The modified ultrafiltration (MUF) had shown benefits on respiratory, and hemodynamic in pediatric patients. This approach in adults is not well established yet. We hypothesize that modified ultrafiltration may improve respiratory, hemodynamic and coagulation function in adults after cardiac surgeries. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was carried out with 37 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were randomized either to MUF (n=20) at the end of bypass or to control (no MUF) (n=17). The anesthesia and ICU team were blinded for the group selection. The MUF were carried out for 15 minutes after the end of bypass. The patients data were taken at beginning of anesthesia, ending of bypass, ending MUF, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery. For clinical outcome the pulmonary, hemodynamic and coagulation function were evaluated. RESULTS: We observed lower drain loss in the MUF group compared to control group after 48 hours (598 +/‐ 123 ml vs. 848 +/‐ 455 ml; P=0.04) and required less red blood cells units transfusion compared to control group (0.6 +/‐ 0.6 units/patient vs.1.6 +/‐ 1.1 units/patient; P=0.03).

However the optimal dose and the efficacy in clinical practice are still debated, as well as the setting of infections that could improve after them. We retrospectively evaluated the infection‐related mortality (IRM, defined as death from infection within 30 days after the last GT) in 57 consecutive pts (median age 45.5 years, range 20‐74; M/F 39/18) with hematological malignancies (48 AML, 5 NHL, 3 ALL, 1 SMD) receiving at least one GT. The indications for GTs were presence of absolute neutrophil count (ANC)<0.5x109/l, fever with evidence of bacterial infections and unresponsiveness to appropriate antimicrobial therapies for at least 48 hours. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT022544230). Infections were mono‐microbial (42 cases) or polymicrobial (15 cases); the most frequent pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Escherichia coli (9) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7). Sepsis occurred in 54 pts. On average, 4 GTs (1‐14) per patient were transfused. The median granulocyte dose per transfusion was 1.95x108/kg (0.53‐7.63). The IRM was 35% (20/57). Pts were grouped according to the median doses of granulocytes received. Doses were derived from the current Italian transfusion regulation and included low‐doses (<1.5‐x108 cells/Kg), standard‐doses (1.5‐3.0x108 cells/Kg) and high‐doses (>3.0x108 cells/Kg). Twelve pts received low‐doses, 28 standard‐doses and 17 high‐doses. The IRM was not influenced by the number of GTs or by the total amount of granulocytes received, whereas a dose‐related effect was observed. Actually, receiving median doses lower than 1.5 or greater than 3.0x108/Kg was associated with higher mortality both at univariate (p=0.002) and multivariate analysis (OR 18.4, 95%CI 2.9‐114.6, p=0.002) (Table1). Moreover, median survivals significantly differed in according to different doses received (27 days vs 61 days, in standard‐ and nonstandard‐groups respectively; HR 4.0, 95%IC 1.6‐10.1; p=0.002). Finally, pts receiving GTs at doses lower or greater than standard had increased risk for subsequent ICU admission (p=0.024). These findings suggest that appropriate GT doses can improve the post infection survival of severely neutropenic hematological patients. Transfusion‐related immunomodulation or leukostasis may underlie the detrimental effect of high dose GTs and deserve further investigations.",2017,EMBASE 620886514,['https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01470855/full'],"{""accession_number"": ""CN-01470855"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Journal article; Conference proceeding"", ""keywords"": [""*granulocyte transfusion"", ""*hematologic malignancy"", ""*infection"", ""Adult"", ""Antimicrobial therapy"", ""Cancer survival"", ""Conference abstract"", ""Controlled clinical trial"", ""Controlled study"", ""Death"", ""Drug megadose"", ""Escherichia coli"", ""Female"", ""Fever"", ""Human"", ""Human cell"", ""Immunomodulation"", ""Infectious agent"", ""Klebsiella pneumoniae"", ""Leukostasis"", ""Low drug dose"", ""Major clinical study"", ""Male"", ""Median survival time"", ""Mortality"", ""Multivariate analysis"", ""Neutrophil count"", ""Nonhuman"", ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", ""Retrospective study"", ""Sepsis""]}"

Acute aluminum phosphide (AlP) poisoning is one of the most common causes of acute pesticide poisoning in Iran. Hydrogen phosphide or phosphine gas is produced following reaction of AlP with water even at ambient humidity. Methemoglobinemia is a rare finding following phosphine poisoning. In this paper, two cases of fatal AlP poisoning complicated by methemoglobinemia are reported. Case Report. Two patients presented following suicidal ingestion of AlP tablets. In the Emergency Department (ED), they received gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate and potassium permanganate. Both of them received supportive care. In each case, hematuria and hemolysis were significant events. The patients also showed a decrease in O2 saturation in spite of high FIO2. Methemoglobin levels of 40% and 30% were detected by co-oximetry. Neither patient responded to treatment (ascorbic acid in one case, methylene blue in the other). Both patients died due to systemic effects of phosphine poisoning. Discussion and conclusion. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia may complicate the course of phosphine poisoning that seems resistant to methylene blue and ascorbic acid. Therefore, other treatments including hyperbaric oxygen therapy and exchange blood transfusion should be considered. © The Author(s) 2010.",2011/05//,"SAGE Publications Ltd, 55 City Road, EC1Y 1SP",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/856066046?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""856066046; 361313059"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""aluminum phosphide"", ""fatal poisoning"", ""methemoglobinemia"", ""phosphine"", ""poisoning"", ""suicide"", ""activated carbon"", ""64365-11-3"", ""82228-96-4"", ""20859-73-8"", ""ascorbic acid"", ""134-03-2"", ""15421-15-5"", ""50-81-7"", ""bicarbonate"", ""144-55-8"", ""71-52-3"", ""gluconate calcium"", ""299-28-5"", ""magnesium sulfate"", ""7487-88-9"", ""methylene blue"", ""61-73-4"", ""permanganate potassium"", ""7722-64-7"", ""sorbitol"", ""26566-34-7"", ""50-70-4"", ""53469-19-5"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""52:Toxicology"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""ascorbic acid -- drug therapy -- methemoglobinemia"", ""methylene blue -- intravenous drug administration"", ""methemoglobinemia -- complication"", ""oxygen saturation"", ""hemolysis"", ""intoxication"", ""tablet"", ""methemoglobinemia -- drug therapy -- methylene blue"", ""Iran"", ""aluminum phosphide poisoning"", ""humidity"", ""suicide attempt"", ""ascorbic acid -- drug therapy"", ""stomach lavage"", ""intensive care unit"", ""emergency ward"", ""methemoglobinemia -- drug therapy"", ""water"", ""article"", ""aluminum phosphide -- drug toxicity"", ""methemoglobinemia -- drug therapy -- ascorbic acid"", ""repeated drug dose"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""exchange blood transfusion"", ""case report"", ""hyperbaric oxygen"", ""methylene blue -- drug therapy -- methemoglobinemia"", ""methylene blue -- drug therapy"", ""patient"", ""gas"", ""methemoglobinemia -- diagnosis"", ""priority journal"", ""human"", ""food poisoning"", ""pesticide"", ""oximetry"", ""methemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""hematuria"", ""treatment response"", ""ingestion""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0960327110384287"", ""issn"": ""09603271"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Loghman Hakim Hospital Poison Center, Clinical Toxicology Department, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran , Department of Forensic Toxicology, Legal Medicine Research Center, Legal Medicine Organization, Tehran, Iran , Loghman Hakim Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran , Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran , Faculty of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1417614411, Iran, Toxicological Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran mohammad@tums.ac.ir, Loghman Hakim Hospital Poison Center, Clinical Toxicology Department, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Abdollahi, M., Faculty of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1417614411, Iran"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2011-03-08"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-05"", ""Number of references - 20"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-01"", ""CODEN - HETOE""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Human+and+Experimental+Toxicology&rft.atitle=Methemoglobinemia+in+aluminum+phosphide+poisoning&rft.au=Shadnia%2C+Shahin&rft.aulast=Shadnia&rft.aufirst=Shahin&rft.date=2011-05-01&rft.volume=30&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=250&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Human+and+Experimental+Toxicology&rft.issn=09603271&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F0960327110384287"", ""date"": ""May 2011""}"

This relationship has not been reported in critically injured children.Methods: Children (e18 years old) were enrolled in this longitudinal, prospective, observational, single-center study after admission to the pediatric intensive care unit following critical injury, along with a cohort of outpatient controls. Serial blood sampling was performed to evaluate plasma cytokine levels and innate immune function as measured by ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production capacity.Hypothesis: Innate immune function will be reduced in critically injured children, and the degree of reduction will predict the subsequent development of nosocomial infection.Results: Seventy-six critically injured children (and 21 outpatient controls) were enrolled. Sixteen critically injured subjects developed nosocomial infection. Those subjects had higher plasma interleukin 6 and interleukin 10 levels on posttrauma days 1-2 compared with those who recovered without infection and outpatient controls. Ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α production capacity was lower on posttrauma days 1-2 (P = 0.006) and over the first week following injury (P = 0.04) in those who went on to develop infection. A TNF-α response of less than 520 pg/mL at any time in the first week after injury was highly associated with infection risk by univariate and multivariate analysis. Among transfused children, longer red blood cell storage age, not transfusion volume, was associated with lower innate immune function (P < 0.0001). Trauma-induced innate immune suppression was reversible ex vivo via coculture of whole blood with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.Conclusions: Trauma-induced innate immune suppression is common in critically injured children and is associated with increased risks for the development of nosocomial infection. Potential exacerbating factors, including red blood cell transfusion, and potential therapies for pediatric trauma-induced innate immune suppression are deserving of further study.",2014,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1635257139?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1635257139; 53219441"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Complications"", ""Pediatric"", ""PICU"", ""Suppression"", ""TNF-α"", ""Trauma"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""7:Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""26:Immunology, Serology and Transplantation"", ""critically ill patient"", ""hospital admission"", ""immune deficiency"", ""cytokine response"", ""Article"", ""granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor"", ""longitudinal study"", ""observational study"", ""plasma transfusion"", ""blood sampling"", ""fresh frozen plasma"", ""interleukin 10 -- endogenous compound"", ""clinical article"", ""innate immunity"", ""tumor necrosis factor alpha -- endogenous compound"", ""intensive care unit"", ""injury"", ""female"", ""human"", ""ex vivo study"", ""artery catheter"", ""burn"", ""cytokine production"", ""artificial ventilation"", ""central venous catheter"", ""erythrocyte preservation"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""infection risk"", ""convalescence"", ""coculture"", ""controlled study"", ""Foley balloon catheter"", ""hospital infection -- etiology"", ""prospective study"", ""multiple trauma"", ""interleukin 6 -- endogenous compound"", ""mortality"", ""prediction"", ""adolescent"", ""lipopolysaccharide"", ""age"", ""male"", ""child""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000000217"", ""issn"": ""10732322"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Columbus, OH, United States, Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Critical Care Medicine, 700 Children-s Dr, Columbus, OH, 43205, United States mark.hall@nationwidechildrens.org, Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, OH, United States , Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Critical Care Medicine, 700 Children-s Dr, Columbus, OH, 43205, United States , Department of Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, United States , Pediatric Surgery, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, United States , Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States , Division of Hematology, Ohio State University, College of Medicine, Columbus, United States , Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, OH, United States , Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Columbus, OH, United States, Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Critical Care Medicine, 700 Children-s Dr, Columbus, OH, 43205, United States, Hall, Mark W., Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Critical Care Medicine, 700 Children-s Dr, Columbus, OH, 43205, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2014-12-12"", ""Date revised - 2015-06-11"", ""Number of references - 35"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - SAGUA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Shock&rft.atitle=Innate+immune+function+predicts+the+development+of+nosocomial+infection+in+critically+injured+children&rft.au=Muszynski%2C+Jennifer+A.&rft.aulast=Muszynski&rft.aufirst=Jennifer&rft.date=2014-01-01&rft.volume=42&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=313&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Shock&rft.issn=10732322&rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2FSHK.0000000000000217"", ""date"": ""2014""}"
aebb5b01-2f30-45ed-84d0-e0c2c6f7203b,The effect of blood transfusion and tranexamic acid on length of hospital stay and mortality after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients,"['Akdoğan, Mutlu', 'Atilla, Halis Atıl']",Turk Geriatri Dergisi,23,3,353-361,"Introduction: The timely and appropriate administration of the transfusion of blood and/or blood components may considerably improve patient outcomes of geriatric hip fractures. However, the transfusion requirement is not free of complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of geriatric hip fracture patients who required transfusion and antifibrinolytic treatment. Material-Method: This study included geriatric patients with a hip fracture who were admitted to our institution between 2017 and 2018. Patient outcomes were evaluated in respect of mortality and length of hospital stay according to the need for blood transfusion. Results: The data of 502 patients were analyzed. In-hospital mortality was recorded for 20 patients (4%). A median of 2 units of red blood cells were used in 218 patients (43.4%), median 2 units of platelet concentrates were used in 4 patients (0.8%), and a median of 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were used in 29 patients (5.8%). Length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit stay were significantly higher for patients who received blood products (p<0.05). The inpatient mortality rates were similar for patients who received and did not receive blood products (p>0.05) but were significantly low in patients who received tranexamic acid (1.2% vs. 5.3% respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion: Blood transfusion in geriatric hip fractures is often associated with long-term hospital and intensive care stays and mortality. In addition, the results of this study revealed that inpatient mortality is significantly low in elderly patients with hip fractures who administered TXA perioperatively.",2020,Geriatrics Society,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2452149588?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2452149588; 2005213524"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Blood transfusion"", ""Geriatrics"", ""Hip fractures"", ""Length of stay"", ""Mortality"", ""Tranexamic acid"", ""acetylsalicylic acid"", ""493-53-8"", ""50-78-2"", ""53663-74-4"", ""53664-49-6"", ""63781-77-1"", ""creatinine"", ""19230-81-0"", ""60-27-5"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""tranexamic acid"", ""1197-18-8"", ""701-54-2"", ""Embase"", ""25:Hematology"", ""33:Orthopedic Surgery"", ""20:Gerontology and Geriatrics"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- endogenous compound"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""major clinical study"", ""Article"", ""hematocrit"", ""postoperative period"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""plate fixation"", ""chronic kidney failure"", ""operation duration"", ""hip replacement"", ""creatinine -- endogenous compound"", ""hip fracture -- surgery"", ""intensive care unit"", ""periprosthetic fracture"", ""female"", ""femur intertrochanteric fracture"", ""human"", ""hospital mortality"", ""thrombocyte concentrate -- endogenous compound"", ""blood transfusion"", ""cardiovascular disease"", ""femur trochanteric fracture"", ""aged"", ""asthma"", ""intramedullary nailing"", ""blood component"", ""erythrocyte"", ""femur pertrochanteric fracture"", ""femoral neck fracture"", ""length of stay"", ""mortality"", ""hip arthroplasty"", ""hypertension"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.31086/tjgeri.2020.171"", ""issn"": ""13042947"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazit Research and Training Hospital, Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ankara, Turkey dratilatilla@hotmail.com, Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazit Research and Training Hospital, Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ankara, Turkey, Atilla, Halis Atıl, Dışkapı Yıldırım Beyazit Research and Training Hospital, Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ankara, Turkey"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2020-11-11"", ""Date revised - 2020-11-11"", ""Number of references - 28"", ""Last updated - 2020-11-11""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Turk+Geriatri+Dergisi&rft.atitle=The+effect+of+blood+transfusion+and+tranexamic+acid+on+length+of+hospital+stay+and+mortality+after+hip+fracture+surgery+in+elderly+patients&rft.au=Akdo%C4%9Fan%2C+Mutlu&rft.aulast=Akdo%C4%9Fan&rft.aufirst=Mutlu&rft.date=2020-01-01&rft.volume=23&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=353&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Turk+Geriatri+Dergisi&rft.issn=13042947&rft_id=info:doi/10.31086%2Ftjgeri.2020.171"", ""date"": ""2020""}"

Methods: We conducted retrospective analysis using National Health Insurance Database (NHID) obtained from 2006 to 2015. Only patients who died of cancer have included. Monthly medical expenditure spent for detailed purposes, such as outpatient (OP) fee, hospitalization cost, and medication, per person were collected at the EOL, defined as 1 year before death, in order to compare cost trend between two cancer types. We also reviewed on medication usage by pre-defined therapeutic categories and healthcare utilization such as the number of OP and emergency room (ER) visits, blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, length of stay (LOS) and LOS in intensive care unit (ICU) per month. Results: Among 8,719 patients who died because of cancer, 349 (4%) were HM patients and 8,370 (96%) were ST patients. Overall 1–year cost trends in HM patients fluctuated, while those of ST patients showed gradual trend. Monthly medical expenditure spent at the last month before death (MBD) in HM patients was 2.7 times higher than that in ST patients. Among total cost, medication accounted for 54.8% in HM patients compared to 34.2% in ST patients. The cost spent for anticancer drugs, antibiotics, narcotics, blood preparation were higher in HM patients compared to ST patients at the last MBD. The proportion of patients who received anticancer drugs, blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was higher in HM patients at the last MBD (39.3% vs 26.1%; p<0.01, 57.6% vs 26.2%; p<0.01, 13.8% vs 5.1%; p<0.01).

The data were collected retrospectively from our hospital’s records after ethical committee approval. In this study, patients were divided into two groups as those who received blood and those who did not and were compared in terms of postoperative cerebrovascular incident, new-onset dialysis, infection, prolonged ICU length of stay, and mortality. Results: In the study, 63.5% (n=73) of the patients were female and 36.5% (n=42) were male. The CPB time of the patients who received postoperative blood transfusion was found to be statistically significantly higher. Preoperative hematocrit levels were significantly lower and postoperative morbidities and mortality rates were significantly higher in the transfusion group. Age, CPB time, postoperative dialysis, inotropic use, transfusion of more than 5 units of blood were independent factors that increases the mortality according to the univariate and multivariate analyses.

Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), a functional viscoelastometric method for real-time hemostasis testing, may allow early identification of coagulopathy and improve transfusion practices. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ROTEM-guided blood product management on perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in ASD patients undergoing correction with pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO).METHODSThe authors retrospectively reviewed patients with ASD who underwent single-level lumbar PSO at the University of Virginia Health System. All patients who received ROTEM-guided blood product transfusion between 2015 and 2017 were matched in a 1:1 ratio to a historical cohort treated using conventional laboratory testing (control group). Co-primary outcomes were intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL) and total blood product transfusion volume. Secondary outcomes were perioperative transfusion requirements and postoperative subfascial drain output.RESULTSThe matched groups (ROTEM and control) comprised 17 patients each. Comparison of matched group baseline characteristics demonstrated differences in female sex and total intraoperative dose of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA). Although EBL was comparable between ROTEM versus control (3200.00 ± 2106.24 ml vs 3874.12 ± 2224.22 ml, p = 0.36), there was a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.31) on EBL reduction with ROTEM. The ROTEM group had less total blood product transfusion volume (1624.18 ± 1774.79 ml vs 2810.88 ± 1847.46 ml, p = 0.02), and the effect size was medium to large (Cohen's d = 0.66). This difference was no longer significant after adjusting for TXA (β = -0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1995.78 to 671.64, p = 0.32). More cryoprecipitate and less fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were transfused in the ROTEM group patients (cryoprecipitate units: 1.24 ± 1.20 vs 0.53 ± 1.01, p = 0.03; FFP volume: 119.76 ± 230.82 ml vs 673.06 ± 627.08 ml, p < 0.01), and this remained significant after adjusting for TXA (cryoprecipitate units: β = 0.39, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.73, p = 0.04; FFP volume: β = -0.41, 95% CI -772.55 to -76.30, p = 0.02). Drain output was lower in the ROTEM group and remained significant after adjusting for TXA.CONCLUSIONSFor ASD patients treated using lumbar PSO, more cryoprecipitate and less FFP were transfused in the ROTEM group compared to the control group. These preliminary findings suggest ROTEM-guided therapy may allow early identification of hypofibrinogenemia, and aggressive management of this may reduce blood loss and total blood product transfusion volume. Additional prospective studies of larger cohorts are warranted to identify the appropriate subset of ASD patients who may benefit from intraoperative ROTEM analysis.",2019,United States,https://doi.org/10.3171/2019.1.FOCUS18572,"{""pmid"": 30933918, ""electronic_issn"": ""1092-0684"", ""linking_issn"": ""1092-0684"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""100896471"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Antifibrinolytic Agents"", ""qualifier"": ""therapeutic use"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Loss, Surgical"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cohort Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemostasis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Lumbar Vertebrae"", ""qualifier"": ""surgery"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Osteotomy"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Pilot Projects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Scoliosis"", ""qualifier"": ""surgery"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Spine"", ""qualifier"": ""abnormalities"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Thrombelastography"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Tranexamic Acid"", ""qualifier"": ""therapeutic use"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Treatment Outcome"", ""major"": false}], ""keywords"": [""ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists"", ""ASD = adult spinal deformity"", ""CI = confidence interval"", ""EBL = estimated blood loss"", ""EXTEM = external temogram"", ""FFP = fresh frozen plasma"", ""FIBTEM = fibrinogen temogram"", ""ICU = intensive care unit"", ""INR = international normalized ratio"", ""POC = point-of-care"", ""POD = postoperative day"", ""PSO = pedicle subtraction osteotomy"", ""ROTEM = rotational thromboelastometry"", ""SPO = Smith-Petersen osteotomy"", ""TLIF = transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion"", ""TXA = tranexamic acid"", ""adult spinal deformity"", ""bleeding"", ""hypofibrinogenemia"", ""pRBC = packed red blood cell"", ""pedicle subtraction osteotomy"", ""rotational thromboelastometry"", ""scoliosis"", ""spine surgery""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2019 Apr 1"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2018-10-22"", ""accepted"": ""2019-01-24"", ""published"": ""2019-04-02""}}"

It was hypothesized that, despite a large allocation of resources to trauma patients receiving more than 50 units of blood products in the first 24 hours, outcome data would support the continued practice of massive transfusion. METHODS: A retrospective review of charts and registry data of trauma patients who received over 50 units of blood products in the first day was conducted for a 5-year period at a Level I trauma center. Patients were stratified into groups on the basis of the number of transfusions received. Results are expressed as mean +/- SD. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify those risk factors determined in the first 24 hours after admission that were predictive of mortality. Physiologic differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were also examined. RESULTS: Of 7,734 trauma patients admitted between July 1, 1995, and June 30, 2000, 44 (0.6%) received > 50 units of blood products in the first day. Overall mortality in these patients was 57%. There was no significant difference (p = 0.565, chi2) in mortality rate between patients who received > 75 units of blood products in the first day versus those who received 51 to 75 units. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified only one independent risk factor, base deficit > 12 mmol/L, associated with mortality. Base deficit > 12 mmol/L increases the risk of death by 5.5 times (p = 0.013; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-20.95). Neither the total blood product transfusion requirement in the first day nor the packed red blood cell transfusion amount in the first day were significant independent risk factors. Causes of the 25 deaths in this series included exsanguination in the operating room (n = 1) or in the surgical intensive care unit (n = 12), multiple organ failure/sepsis (n = 3), head injury (n = 3), respiratory failure (n = 2), cerebrovascular accident (n = 1), and other (n = 3). Of the survivors, 63% were discharged to home, 21% to rehabilitation, 11% to nursing home, and 5% to another acute care facility. Of the nonsurvivors, the mean Injury Severity Score was 43, 88% had a base deficit > 12 mmol/L, 68% had a Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8, and 64% had a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score > 10. CONCLUSION: The 43% survival rate in trauma patients receiving > 50 units of blood products warrants continued aggressive transfusion therapy in the first 24 hours after admission.",2002,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005373-200208000-00017,"{""pmid"": 12169936, ""print_issn"": ""0022-5282"", ""linking_issn"": ""0022-5282"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""0376373"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Analysis of Variance"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Banks"", ""qualifier"": ""economics"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""economics"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cost-Benefit Analysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Health Care Costs"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Logistic Models"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Multivariate Analysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""North Carolina"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Survival Rate"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2002 Aug"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2002-08-10""}}"

Blood sampling is a critical aspect of intensive care to guide clinical decision-making. Repeated blood sampling can result in blood waste and contamination, leading to iatrogenic anaemia and systemic infection. REVIEW METHOD USED: Cochrane systematic review methods were used including meta-analysis, and independent reviewers. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PUBMED and EMBASE databases. The search was limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs, published in English between 2000 and 2021. REVIEW METHODS: Paired authors independently assessed database search results and identified eligible studies. Trials comparing any blood conservation practice or product in intensive care were included. Primary outcomes were blood sample volumes and haemoglobin change. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients receiving transfusions and infection outcomes. Quality appraisal employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analysis using random effects approach and narrative synthesis summarised findings. RESULTS: Eight studies (n = 1027 patients), all RCTs were eligible. Six studies included adults, one studied paediatrics and one studied preterm infants. Seven studies evaluated a closed loop blood sampling system, and one studied a conservative phlebotomy protocol. Studies were of low to moderate quality. Meta-analysis was not possible for interventions targeting blood sample volumes or haemoglobin. Decreased blood sample volumes reported in four studies were attributable to a closed loop system or conservative phlebotomy. No study reported a significant change in haemoglobin. Meta-analysis demonstrated that use of a closed system (compared to open system) reduced the proportion of patients receiving transfusion [Risk Ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.92; 287 patients] and reduced intraluminal fluid colonisation [RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.58; 500 patients]. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence demonstrates closed loop blood sampling systems reduced transfusion use and fluid colonisation. Simultaneous effectiveness-implementation evaluation of these systems and blood conservation strategies is urgently required.

Conventionally by most thoracic surgeons, a perioperative haemoglobin (Hb) less than 10 g/dl has been considered a transfusion trigger. In this prospective trial we have (a) evaluated the overall blood transfusion requirements and factors associated with an increased need for transfusion and (b) in a subsequent subset of patients, tested the hypothesis that elective anaemia after major lung resection may be safely tolerated in the early postoperative period. METHODS: A total of 198 (M/F 179/10, mean age 61.2, range 32--85 years) patients suffering from NSCLC were submitted to pneumonectomy (n = 89), bilobectomy (n = 19) and lobectomy (n = 90). A rather strict protocol was used as a transfusion strategy. The transfusion requirements were analyzed and seven parameters (gender, age > 65, preoperative Hb < 11.5 g/dl, chest wall resection, history of previous thoracotomy, pneumonectomy and total blood loss) were statistically evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analysis. Subsequently, according to the perioperative Hb level during the first 48 h, patients were divided into group A (n = 49, Hb = 8.5--10) and group B (n = 149, Hb > 10) with a view to estimate the risks of elective perioperative anaemia. Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, type of operation performed, preoperative Hb, creatinine level, FEV1, arterial blood gases and history of heart disease. RESULTS: The overall transfusion rate was 16%. Univariate analysis revealed that preoperative Hb < 11.5 g/dl (P < 0.01) and total blood loss (P < 0.0001) were associated with increased need for transfusion, but only the total blood loss was identified as an independent variable in multivariate analysis. Statistical analysis between groups A and B showed no significant difference regarding postoperative morbidity and mortality: atelectasis (3 vs. 6), chest infection (2 vs. 9), sputum retention requiring bronchoscopy (5 vs. 12), admission to intensive care unit (5 vs. 7), ARDS (0 vs. 3), postoperative hospital stay (7.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 9.1 +/- 3.8 days) and deaths (1 vs. 3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a strict transfusion strategy could help in reducing overall blood transfusion.

Aim: Evaluation of the prevalence, risk factors, indications, associated complications, and neonatal outcomes of PPH performed in our clinic. Patients and Methods: A total of 35 patients who underwent PPH in our clinic between 2013 and 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, age, gestational week, delivery type, type of hysterectomy performed, length of hospital stay, PPH indications, additional procedures and complications during PPH, maternal and fetal mortality, neonatal characteristics, intensive care unit (ICU) need after PPH, and blood transfusion amount and time were recorded. Patients with PPH were subdivided and studied in subgroups: Emergency - elective surgery, total - subtotal hysterectomy. Results: PPH was performed in 35 (3.2/1000) patients who gave birth during the study period. The most common indication for hysterectomy was placental invasion anomaly (57.1%, n = 20), and the most performed operation was total hysterectomy (68.6%, n = 24). Bilateral hypogastric artery ligation (14.3%, n = 5) was the most common alternative procedure performed before hysterectomy, and the most common complication was bladder injury (22.9%, n = 8). Blood transfusion was performed in 94.3% (n = 33) of the patients due to acute blood loss. The mean newborn weight was 2788.79 ± 913.37 g, and the 1st and 5th-minute APGAR scores were 6.71 ± 2.25 and 7.56 ± 2.35, respectively. Conclusion: Before PPH, uterine integrity should be preserved using medical and surgical methods, but if success is not achieved, hysterectomy is the last life-saving step. It should be kept in mind that in patients with anemia and increased gravidity, the risk of bleeding may be high in the first 24 h after birth and therefore PPH may be required.

Method: A single centre, observational, prospective cohort study at a large tertiary referral centre was undertaken. Data were collected on patients presenting to the Emergency Department referred to Gastroenterology for suspected overt GIB from June 2015 to March 2016. Data collected included patient demographics, medical history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, management, risk scores (AIMS65, Blatchford) and outcomes (LOS, rebleeding and death). Univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken to determine predictors of increased LOS and death. Results: One hundred twenty-five patients were analysed; 67% of participants were male, the median age was 66 years, 62.4% were of non-English speaking backgrounds, and 68.8% had significant comorbidities. A total of 54% had a final diagnosis of non-variceal upper GIB. The median LOS was 5.0 days (Table 1). Factors predictive of increasing median LOS on univariate analysis included presence of a major comorbidity (6 days vs 3 days, p<0.001), age over 50 (5 days vs 4 days, p = 0.02), ICU admission (12 days vs 4 days, p = 0.001), variceal upper GIB (10 days vs 2.5 days, p = 0.01) and lower GIB (8 days vs 2.5 days, p = 0.003). Factors correlated with LOS on univariate analysis included increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, CSHA clinical frailty score, AIMS65 score and RBC transfusion amount (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, predictors of increased LOS (>5 days) included RBC transfusion (HR 3.88; 95% CI 1.25-12; p = 0.019), major comorbidities (HR 4.7, 95% CI 1.27-17.5; p = 0.02) and variceal upper GIB (HR 10.2; 95% CI 1.04-99). Factors predictive of death on univariate analysis included age over 50 (12% mortality vs 0%, p = 0.07) and presence of a major comorbidity (12.8% mortality vs 2,6%, p = 0.07), as well as increasing CCI score (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.03-1.56; p = 0.03), CHSA clinical frailty score (HR 1.91; 95% CI 1.25-2.9; p = 0.003), Blatchford score (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.04-1.58; p = 0.02) and AIMS65 (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.58-5.3; p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis for independent predictors of death, the only significant variable was increasing AIMS65 (HR 2.79; 95% CI 1.2-6.4; p = 0.014). Conclusion: Underlying patient factors, as well as the cause of bleeding and management, required predict LOS and in-hospital mortality. The presence of these risk factors may help identify patients who may have prolonged LOS or be at increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

Our primary aim was to identify potential predictors of intraoperative transfusion requirements. Secondarily, we investigated, the effect of transfusion requirements on different clinical outcomes, including short-term morbidity and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data collected in 219 adult LT from a deceased donor, grouped according to HTR (defined as the need of 5 or more red blood cell units), were compared. RESULTS: We found that previous portal vein thromboses (p=0.0156), hemoglobin (Hb) (p<0.0001), International Normalized Ratio (INR) (p=0.0010) at transplant and veno-venous by-pass (p=0.0048) independently predicted HTR. HTR was always associated with poorer outcomes, including higher simplified acute physiology II score at Intensive Care Unit admission (p=0.0005), higher rates of pulmonary infections (p=0.0015) and early rejection (p=0.0176), longer requirement of mechanical ventilation, (p<0.0001), more frequent need for hemodialysis after transplantation (p=0.0036), overall survival (p=0.0010) and rate of day-90 survival (p=0.0016). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified specific risk factors for HTR and confirmed the negative impact exerted by HTR on clinical outcomes, including recipient survival.

FAST-MI is a nationwide registry that was carried out over a 1-month period in 2005 and included consecutive patients with AMI admitted to intensive care units <48 hours from symptom onset in 223 participating centers. We assessed the impact of a clopidogrel LD (≥300 mg) compared to a conventional dose (<300 mg) on bleeding, need for blood transfusion, and 30-day and 12-month survivals in 791 elderly patients (≥75 years old, mean age 81 ± 4 years, 48% women, 35% with ST-segment elevation MI) included in this registry. Fifty-nine percent (466 patients) received a clopidogrel LD. Follow-up was >99% complete. Major bleeding and blood transfusions were not significantly different in patients who received a clopidogrel LD (3.2% vs 3.7%, p = 0.72; 5.4% vs 6.2%, p = 0.64, respectively). Early mortality was also not significantly different (10.1 vs 10.8, p = 0.76). Using multivariate analyses, clopidogrel LD did not significantly affect major bleeding or transfusion (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 2.17, p = 0.94) and 12-month mortality (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.40, p = 0.98). In conclusion, the present data showed that in elderly patients admitted for AMI, use of a LD of clopidogrel compared to a conventional dose was not associated with increased in-hospital bleeding, need for transfusion, or mortality.

Although packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion appears to increase brain tissue oxygen, it is unknown whether such transfusions, which are commonly administered in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, alter outcome. OBJECTIVE: Following up on our observation that anemia is associated with poor outcome in patients with ICH, we investigated whether PRBC transfusion was associated with any benefit. METHODS: Five hundred forty-six consecutive subjects were identified from an ongoing single-center, prospective cohort study of nontraumatic ICH over a 6-year period. Clinical and radiographic characteristics, laboratory values including admission and daily mean hemoglobin values, and all instances of PRBC transfusion were recorded. Aggressiveness of care was assessed by whether the patient had a ""do not resuscitate"" order activated during hospitalization. The primary endpoint was 30-day survival. RESULTS: Anemia was present in 144 of 546 patients (26%) on admission and developed subsequently in an additional 250, leaving just 152 of 546 patients (28%) who never developed anemia. PRBC transfusion was administered to 100 patients (18%) during their hospital stay, 98% of whom were anemic. In multivariable analysis, PRBC transfusion was associated with improved survival at 30 days (odds ratio: 2.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.45-5.26; P =.002). CONCLUSION: Anemia develops in the majority of patients with ICH at some point during their hospitalization. PRBC transfusion was associated with improved outcome in these patients.

Obesity was defined as BMI greater or equal to 30 kg/m2. PEC-S was defined by current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The primary outcome was a composite defined as one or more than the following: liver or renal failure, thrombocytopenia, abruption, blood transfusion, pulmonary edema, DIC, stroke, eclampsia, ICU admission. Chi-square analyses and Fishers exact test were used for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds. RESULTS: 193 women with PEC-S were included: 100 (51.8%) nonobese and 93 (48.2%) obese. Obese women were significantly less likely to have the composite outcome compared to non-obese women (9.7% vs. 21.0%, OR 0.40 [0.17-0.93], p50.03). This decreased risk remained after adjusting for race, mode of delivery, and parity; aOR 0.38 [0.16-0.94], p50.035. Within the composite outcome, obese women were less likely to have a blood transfusion (p=0.04) and had a non-significant lower risk of renal failure (p=0.13). Obese women were more likely to require IV antihypertensive medication (p=0.03) and to be discharged on oral antihypertensive medication (p=0.08) compared to non-obese women. CONCLUSION: Obese women with PEC-S have a lower risk of adverse maternal outcomes than non-obese women with PEC-S. This may reflect a different, less severe, phenotype for PEC-S in obese women compared to non-obese women and warrants further investigation.",2017/05//,W.B.

We aimed to determine whether a previous PSS worsens the prognosis of patients who undergo OLT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1986 and October 2003, 520 liver transplants were performed in 467 patients in our center. Thirteen patients had undergone a PSS before OLT. The types of PSS were: portocaval (n = 8), splenorenal (n = 3), mesocaval (n = 1), and portoatrial (n = 1). We compared patients with previous PSS (cases) and the three patients with an OLT immediately before each case (controls). We analyzed the following variables: age, Child-Pugh stage, pretransplant liver disease, surgical times, transfusion requirements, infections, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, postoperative evolution, and survival. RESULTS: Age, Child-Pugh stage, and pretransplant liver disease were similar in both groups. There were no statistical differences in age, surgical times, ischemia time, anhepatic phase, transfusion requirements, ICU stay, infections, or hospital stay. The postoperative course was similar in both groups. Long-term survival was 84.62% in cases versus 78.5% in controls.

However, clinical studies have not consistently demonstrated that this therapeutic maneuver is accompanied by an increase in oxygen utilization at either the whole-body level or within individual organs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of red blood cell transfusion on gastrointestinal and whole-body oxygen uptake. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, interventional study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three critically ill patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systemic oxygen uptake was measured by indirect calorimetry and calculated by the Fick method. Gastric intramucosal pH as measured by tonometry was used to assess changes in splanchnic oxygen availability. Measurements were made prior to transfusion of 3 U of packed red blood cells. These were then repeated immediately following transfusion, as well as 3 and 6 hours later. There was no increase in systemic oxygen uptake measured by indirect calorimetry in any of the patients studied for up to 6 hours posttransfusion (including those patients with an elevated arterial lactate concentration). However, the calculated systemic oxygen uptake increased in parallel with the oxygen delivery in all the patients. More importantly, we found an inverse association between the change in gastric intramucosal pH and the age of the transfused blood (r = -.71; P < .001). In those patients receiving blood that had been stored for more than 15 days, the gastric intramucosal pH consistently decreased following the red blood cell transfusion. CONCLUSION: We failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of red blood cell transfusion on measured systemic oxygen uptake in patients with sepsis. Patients receiving old transfused red blood cells developed evidence of splanchnic ischemia. We postulate that the poorly deformable transfused red blood cells cause micro-circulatory occlusion in some organs, which may lead to tissue ischemia in some organs.",1993,United States,,"{""pmid"": 8501845, ""print_issn"": ""0098-7484"", ""linking_issn"": ""0098-7484"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""7501160"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adenine"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Bacterial Infections"", ""qualifier"": ""blood"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Bacterial Infections"", ""qualifier"": ""physiopathology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Bacterial Infections"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Component Transfusion"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Preservation"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Calorimetry, Indirect"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Citrates"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Gastric Mucosa"", ""qualifier"": ""physiopathology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Glucose"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Oxygen Consumption"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Phosphates"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Respiration, Artificial"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Stomach"", ""qualifier"": ""physiopathology"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""1993 Jun 16"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""1993-06-16""}}"

Both incidence and patient and transfusion-related risk factors are well studied in the adult critically ill patient population. Clinical data on TRALI in the pediatric population are sparse and are mainly limited to case reports and hemovigilance reporting systems. The objective of this study was to determine incidence, risk factors, and outcome of TRALI in critically ill children. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, all first-time admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit from January 1, 2009, until December 31, 2012, were screened for onset of TRALI using the consensus criteria. Results: Of 2294 admitted patients, 304 were transfused, of whom 21 (6.9%) developed TRALI. Compared with transfused control subjects, risk factors for TRALI were mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 18.94 [2.38-2452.56]), sepsis (odds ratio, 7.20 [2.69-19.69]), and high Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score (odds ratio, 1.05 [1.01-1.10]). Patients with TRALI had a higher mortality and a longer duration of mechanical ventilation when compared with transfused control subjects. Conclusions: Transfusion-related ALI is relatively common in critically ill children. The incidence in the pediatric intensive care unit population is similar to that in adult intensive care unit patients. High PRISM score on admission, mechanical ventilation and sepsis were identified as independent risk factors, which may help to assess the risks and benefits of transfusion in critically ill patients.",2015/02/01/,W.B.

20ff68dc-bba8-4b66-995a-7195710bb64b,Acute kidney injury after major cardiac surgery correlates with transfusion of packed red blood cells and their degradation products,"['Greite, Robert', 'Tudorache, Igor', 'Vijayan, Vijith', 'Doricic, Julian', 'Kreimann, Kirill', 'Leffler, Andreas', 'Fegbeutel, Christine', 'Haverich, Axel', 'Lichtinghagen, Ralf', 'Haller, Hermann', 'Gwinner, Wilfried', 'Immenschuh, Stephan', 'Gueler, Faikah']",Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,34,,a143,"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe complication after cardiac surgery. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC) is often necessaryto compensate blood loss during surgery. Aging of pRBC results in release of toxic degradation products such as extracellular hemoglobin (hb), labile heme and free iron which mediates acute organ dysfunction. This pilot study investigated the level of labile heme from pRBC which were administered during cardiac surgery in patients with preexisting renal function impairment. METHODS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery (valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting, n= 9) at the Hannover Medical School were included in a prospective clinical trial and blood was drawn before surgery, at admission on ICU, 6h and 24h, 3 and 7 days after surgery. Samples of pRBC given during surgery were collected immediately prior transfusion. The labile heme quantification in pRBC was done by apo peroxidase enzyme activity measurement and correlated with clinical outcome. In addition, we tested samples from the Hannover Blood Bank which retrieved pRBC from 14 different donors (450 mL blood in 63 mL citrate phosphate dextrose) by the whole blood filtration method. Aliquots were collected weekly and tested for degradation products by measuring free hemoglobin and labile heme. In addition, supernatants of the pRBC were exposed to freshly isolated primary human neutrophils and CD11b expression was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: AKI developed in 4/9 patients of whom n=2 required dialysis. All patients received at least two pRBC transfusions. Indicators of complicated surgery such as duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass time or aortic cross clamp time did not differ between patients with and without AKI. Patients developing AKI received higher cumulative amounts of labile heme than patients without AKI. Labile heme transfused per patient significantly correlated with the maximum creatinine elevation within 48 hours after surgery (r=0.7 p=0.04). In the in vitro experiments, an exponential increase of labile heme release occurred from day 28 until day 42. The supernatants from long term stored pRBC markedly activated freshly isolated primary human neutrophils as determined by surface expression of CD11b. CONCLUSIONS: Storage of pRBC leads to degradation with formation of labile heme. The amount of labile heme in pRBCs administered during cardiac surgery was associated with postoperative AKI in patients with pre-existing renal function impairment. Labile heme is pro-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive and can cause microcirculatory disturbance in different organs.

4cb0021b-265b-4080-be32-9889287858e3,Implementing and sustaining Point of Care ROTEM® into a trauma activation protocol for the management of patients with traumatic injury: A mixed-methods study,"['Wake, Elizabeth', 'Walters, Kerin', 'Winearls, James', 'Marshall, Andrea P.']",Australian critical care : official journal of the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses,36,3,336-344,"BACKGROUND: Up to 40% of patients with traumatic injury experience critical bleeding, many requiring transfusion of blood products. International transfusion guidelines recommend the use of viscoelastic testing to guide blood product replacement. We implemented a Point of Care ROTEM® blood test for trauma patients who present and initiate a trauma activation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to undertake an evaluation of the implementation data to identify factors which helped and hindered this new practice. METHODS: A sequential mixed-methods design was conducted to evaluate intervention implementation. The intervention was designed with interprofessional collaboration and incorporated education and skills training supplemented with a decision aide. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who met the trauma activation criteria were included. Data collection occurred throughout the 21-month implementation period inclusive of initial roll out, maintenance and sustainability and include the number of ROTEM® blood tests taken and clinical characteristics of patients. Individual interviews were conducted with health professionals with experience of the intervention after the implementation period was complete. RESULTS: A total of 1570 eligible patients were included. The number of patients who had a ROTEM® blood test taken increased over time to 63%. The proportion of patients having a ROTEM® blood test obtained was higher for major trauma patients (n=162, 66.9%) who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Regression analysis found trauma service presence on arrival and the sustainability phase of implementation increased the likelihood of having a ROTEM® taken. Qualitative data suggest that a more tailored approach to intervention implementation would assist with adoption. CONCLUSION: Implementation of new practice requires careful planning and should be undertaken with input from end-users. Continuous evaluation is necessary to support ongoing implementation and sustainability. To ensure effective implementation occurs, complex interventions need to be made workable and integrated in everyday health care practice.",2023/05/01/,NLM (Medline),['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2663579555?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2663579555; 637946784"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Coagulation"", ""Point-of-care assessment"", ""Rotational thromboelastometry"", ""Traumatic injury"", ""MEDLINE"", ""blood transfusion"", ""bleeding"", ""blood clotting disorder"", ""point of care system"", ""procedures"", ""human"", ""thromboelastography""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2022.03.001"", ""issn"": ""10367314"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Trauma Service, Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland, Australia; School of Medicine, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia Elizabeth.wake@health.qld.gov.au, Intensive Care Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital, QLD, Australia , Intensive Care Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland, Australia; Senior Lecturer, University of Queensland, Australia , Nursing, Midwifery Education and Research Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland, Australia; Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, Queensland, Australia , Trauma Service, Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland, Australia; School of Medicine, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"", ""Date created - 2023-05-10"", ""Date revised - 2023-05-10"", ""Last updated - 2023-05-10""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Australian+critical+care+%3A+official+journal+of+the+Confederation+of+Australian+Critical+Care+Nurses&rft.atitle=Implementing+and+sustaining+Point+of+Care+ROTEM%C2%AE+into+a+trauma+activation+protocol+for+the+management+of+patients+with+traumatic+injury%3A+A+mixed-methods+study&rft.au=Wake%2C+Elizabeth&rft.aulast=Wake&rft.aufirst=Elizabeth&rft.date=2023-05-01&rft.volume=36&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=336&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Australian+critical+care+%3A+official+journal+of+the+Confederation+of+Australian+Critical+Care+Nurses&rft.issn=10367314&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.aucc.2022.03.001"", ""date"": ""2023 May 01""}"

Large submucosal leiomyoma defined as greater than 5 cm, may have higher complication rates; however, high quality data is limited. Case: A 44-year-old gravida 4 with history of two full-term vaginal deliveries presented at 40 and 2/7 weeks of gestation with premature rupture of membranes and delivered vaginally a viable female infant complicated by a postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. During a manual uterine sweep for suspected retained products of conception, a submucosal leiomyoma was incidentally extracted. Uterine hemorrhage immediately ensued, requiring vasopressors, blood transfusion, and intensive care unit admission. Hemostasis was ultimately achieved with placement of a Bakri balloon. Conclusion: This case reaffirms the association of large (greater than five centimeters) submucosal leiomyoma with severe postpartum hemorrhage.

cb81569a-72b2-4120-bad9-3d76bdcd227b,Storage duration of red blood cells and risk of developing acute lung injury in patients with sepsis,"['Janz, D.R.', 'Koyama, T.', 'Zhao, Z.', 'Cripps, B.', 'Bastarache, J.A.', 'Ware, L.B.']",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,185,,,"RATIONALE: Anemia is a common problem in the critically ill and is treated with transfusion of packed red blood cells(PRBCs) in 40% of patients. Transfusion of PRBCs to critically ill patients has been associated with multi-organ failure, nosocomial infections, increased ICU length of stay, acute lung injury (ALI), and mortality. One potential explanation for these poor outcomes is the deleterious effects of the red cell storage lesion, which worsens over the 42-day storage period. We hypothesized that the duration of storage of PRBCs transfused to ICU patients with sepsis is associated with the development of ALI. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using critically ill patients with sepsis enrolled on the morning of ICU day 2 in the Validating Acute Lung Injury Markers for Diagnosis (VALID) study from January 1, 2008 to July 6, 2010. Data regarding the quantity and storage duration of all PRBCs transfused during the 48 hours prior to enrollment were collected. PRBCs transfused after enrollment were excluded from the analysis. The primary outcome was the development of ALI/ARDS at any point within 72 hours after the exposure period. RESULTS: A total of 563 patients had a diagnosis of sepsis on enrollment into VALID during the study period. There were 253(44.9%) patients in the ALI/ARDS group and 310(55.1%) in the control group. A total of 48(19%) patients with ALI/ARDS received transfusion during the exposure period compared to 46 (14.8%) in the control group. In patients receiving PRBCs, there was no difference in the median number of units transfused to the ALI/ARDS group (2 units, IQR 2-3.25) and control group (2 units, IQR 2-4, p = 0.436). The median storage duration in the ALI/ARDS group was greater(25 days, IQR 20-31) compared to the control group(21 days, IQR 14-26, p = 0.009). After controlling for age, gender, smoking, and APACHE II score in sepsis patients, the odds of developing ALI/ARDS after being transfused an older unit of PRBCs was 3 times greater compared to younger PRBCs (OR 3.21 for the 75th vs 25th percentile of storage duration, 95% CI 1.58-6.53, p = 0.0013)(Figure). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of older PRBCs with a longer duration of storage to patients with sepsis is associated with a higher risk of developing ALI/ARDS up to 3 days after transfusion.

A leukoagglutinin reaction to this blood transfusion was determined to be the cause of the pulmonary edema. When the patient continued to deteriorate after administration of diuretics, vasopressors, corticosteroids, albumin, and maximum respiratory support, the Sci-Med membrane oxygenator was inserted by the right femoral vein-artery. Bypass was continued for approximately 8 hours, until the PaO2 increased and the patient's condition stabilized.

1e3789c7-4bee-4988-b3a9-1f50fc54f17d,Presenting symptom does not predict mortality or morbidity in patients presenting with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"['Chee, D.', 'Hui, S.', 'Nguyen, A.', 'Rajadurai, A.', 'Bloom, A.', 'Worland, T.', 'McNamara, L.', 'Nguyen, P.', 'Chung, W.', 'Robertson, M.']",Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,33,,154-155,"Introduction: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown a prevalence of up to 150 patients per 100 000 population, with a mortality of 3-10% despite current standards of care. Presentation of UGIB varies from frank hematemesis to coffee ground vomitus (CGV), and melena. CGV, defined as the passage of black material which is assumed to be blood, has traditionally been considered to represent lower-risk bleeding when compared with frank hematemesis or melena. Aim: We aimed to compare outcomes and their severity for patients presenting with non-variceal UGIB based on their presenting symptoms (hematemesis, CGV, and/or melena) in an Australian patient cohort. Methods: Patients presenting with UGIB to three Australian centers (two tertiary hospitals and one regional hospital) were prospectively included over a 22-month period from 2016 to 2017. Data were collected by specialist registrars using a purpose-built smartphone app. Background demographics and presenting symptom of UGIB were recorded. Patients with UGIB secondary to variceal bleeding were excluded. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were: a composite end-point of inpatient mortality, rebleeding, and endoscopic, radiological, or surgical intervention; blood transfusion requirement; intensive care unit (ICU) admission; rebleeding; and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: A total of 703 patients were included in the study. Median age was 67 years (IQR, 51-79) and 63% were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 3.7%, and 60 patients (8.5%) experienced rebleeding. Median LOS was 4 days (IQR, 3-7 days), and 417 patients (59%) required blood transfusion, with a median transfusion requirement of 2 units (IQR, 2-4 units). Sixty-seven patients (10%) required repeat endoscopy, eight (1.1%) proceeded to surgery, and 23 (3.3%) required radiological embolization. The most common etiologies of bleeding were gastritis (28%), followed by duodenal (24%) and gastric ulcers (23%). Seventy-one patients (10%) required ICU admission. A total of 161 patients (22.9%) presented with hematemesis and melena (HM), 103 (14.7%) with hematemesis, 37 (5.3%) with CGV, and 402 (57.2%) with melena alone. No difference in mortality was recorded between the groups (HM group, 8 (5%); hematemesis group, 2 (2%); melena group, 16 (4%); CGV group, no deaths). Similarly, no significant difference in the composite endpoint or LOS was detected between groups. Conclusions: The presenting symptom in patients with UGIB is not predictive of mortality or a composite clinical endpoint of inpatient mortality, rebleeding, and endoscopic, radiological, or surgical intervention. Patients with CGV should not be considered low-risk patients.",2018/09//,ACT Publishing Group Liminted,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2123967919?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2123967919; 624430743"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""risk assessment"", ""smartphone"", ""death"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""melena"", ""upper gastrointestinal bleeding"", ""artificial embolization"", ""intensive care unit"", ""female"", ""morbidity"", ""tertiary care center"", ""gastritis"", ""human"", ""hospital mortality"", ""vomiting"", ""low risk patient"", ""blood transfusion"", ""aged"", ""endoscopy"", ""hematemesis"", ""stomach ulcer"", ""controlled study"", ""Australian"", ""prospective study"", ""coffee"", ""specialist registrar"", ""conference abstract"", ""length of stay"", ""multicenter study"", ""male"", ""surgery""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14399"", ""issn"": ""22246509"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Monash Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia , Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Monash Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, Chee, D., Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Monash Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - Gastroenterological Society of Australia, GESA and Australian Gastroenterology Week, AGW \""Gut Matters\"""", ""Copyright - Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2018-10-22"", ""Date revised - 2018-10-22"", ""Last updated - 2018-10-22""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Gastroenterology+and+Hepatology&rft.atitle=Presenting+symptom+does+not+predict+mortality+or+morbidity+in+patients+presenting+with+non-variceal+upper+gastrointestinal+bleeding&rft.au=Chee%2C+D.&rft.aulast=Chee&rft.aufirst=D.&rft.date=2018-09-01&rft.volume=33&rft.issue=&rft.spage=154&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Gastroenterology+and+Hepatology&rft.issn=22246509&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fjgh.14399"", ""date"": ""Sep 2018""}"

We, therefore, compared postoperative pulmonary gas exchange after mitral valve repair between sternotomy (group TLV) and thoracotomy (group OLV). DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTION: Sternotomy or thoracotomy was used for mitral valve repair. MEASUREMENTS: The ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was compared in both groups before induction of anaesthesia (T0) and just before departure from the operating room to the ICU (T1). Fluid administration, transfusion requirements and urine output were checked intraoperatively. Postoperative haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct) and creatinine were evaluated. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, intubation time and ICU stay were also recorded. RESULTS: The PaO2/FiO2 ratio (mean ± SD) at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 in both groups (326.9 ± 120.1 vs. 431.9 ± 73.7 mmHg in group TLV, P < 0.001; 374.9 ± 130.9 vs. 445.4 ± 73.7 mmHg in group OLV, P = 0.001), but did not differ significantly between the two groups. The doses of inotropes and vaopressors used were not significantly different between the groups. Intraoperative fluid administration, transfusion requirements, urine output and postoperative Hb/Hct and creatinine did not differ significantly between the groups. CPB time, intubation time and ICU stay also did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION: Perioperative pulmonary function following OLV via a thoracotomy was not significantly worse than that following TLV via a sternotomy in mitral valve repair.

This study aimed to conduct a prospective study to determine the effects of fast-track surgery on prognosis after liver transplantation. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized study. One hundred twenty-eight patients undergoing liver transplantation were selected for the fast-track (FT group, n=54) or conventional process (NFT group, n=74). The primary endpoints were intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital stay. The secondary endpoints were as follows: operative time, anhepatic phase time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion volume, postoperative complications, readmission rate, and postoperative mortality. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in preoperative demographics between the two groups. The median ICU stay was 2 days (range 1-7 days) in the FT group and 5 days (range 3-12 days) in the NFT group (P<0.01). Furthermore, the hospital stay was also significantly reduced in the FT group (P<0.01). The operative time, anhepatic phase time, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion volume were decreased in the FT group compared with the NFT group (P<0.05). Based on Spearman correlation analysis, the ICU stay and hospital stay may be positively correlated with operative time, anhepatic phase time and intraoperative blood loss.

However, risks of transfusions exist and must be weighed against potential benefits each time a transfusion is considered. The present review seeks to bring together the published data supporting 2 newly postulated risks of transfusions among very low-birth-weight neonates. The first is an association between ""early"" red blood cell transfusions, those administered in the first few days after birth, and the subsequent occurrence of a grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage. The second is an association between ""late"" RBC transfusions and the subsequent occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis. Much remains to be discovered about the pathogenetic links between transfusion and these adverse outcomes. Moreover, work is needed to clearly establish whether transfusions are causatively associated with these adverse outcomes or are covariables. The purpose of this chapter is to review the associations between transfusion and intraventricular hemorrhage and between transfusions and necrotizing enterocolitis and to use these associations to hypothesize that evidence-based improvements in transfusion practice have the potential to improve neonatal intensive care unit outcomes. © 2012.",2012/08//,"W.B.

Austin', 'Williams, Timothy K.', 'Ferencz, Sarah-Ashley E.', 'Davidson, Anders J.', 'Russo, Rachel M.', ""O'Brien, William T."", 'Galante, Joseph M.', 'Grayson, J. Kevin', 'Neff, Lucas P.']",Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,83,1,61-70,"BACKGROUND Despite clinical reports of poor outcomes, the degree to which resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) exacerbates traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not known. We hypothesized that combined effects of increased proximal mean arterial pressure (pMAP), carotid blood flow (Q carotid), and intracranial pressure (ICP) from REBOA would lead to TBI progression compared with partial aortic occlusion (PAO) or no intervention. METHODS Twenty-one swine underwent a standardized TBI via computer Controlled cortical impact followed by 25% total blood volume rapid hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of hypotension, animals were randomized to 60 minutes of continued hypotension (Control), REBOA, or PAO. REBOA and PAO animals were then weaned from occlusion. All animals were resuscitated with shed blood via a rapid blood infuser. Physiologic parameters were recorded continuously and brain computed tomography obtained at specified intervals. RESULTS There were no differences in baseline physiology or during the initial 30 minutes of hypotension. During the 60-minute intervention period, REBOA resulted in higher maximal pMAP (REBOA, 105.3 ± 8.8; PAO, 92.7 ± 9.2; Control, 48.9 ± 7.7; p = 0.02) and higher Q carotid (REBOA, 673.1 ± 57.9; PAO, 464.2 ± 53.0; Control, 170.3 ± 29.4; p < 0.01). Increases in ICP were greatest during blood resuscitation, with Control animals demonstrating the largest peak ICP (Control, 12.8 ± 1.2; REBOA, 5.1 ± 0.6; PAO, 9.4 ± 1.1; p < 0.01). There were no differences in the percentage of animals with hemorrhage progression on CT (Control, 14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-57.9; REBOA, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0; and PAO, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0). CONCLUSION In an animal model of TBI and shock, REBOA increased Q carotid and pMAP, but did not exacerbate TBI progression. PAO resulted in physiology closer to baseline with smaller increases in ICP and pMAP. Rapid blood resuscitation, not REBOA, resulted in the largest increase in ICP after intervention, which occurred in Control animals. Continued studies of the cerebral hemodynamics of aortic occlusion and blood transfusion are required to determine optimal resuscitation strategies for multi-injured patients.",2017/07/01/,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1922436646?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1922436646; 617381770"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Paper"", ""keywords"": [""endovascular"", ""intra-aortic balloon"", ""resuscitation"", ""shock"", ""Traumatic brain injury"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""14:Radiology"", ""18:Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Surgery"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""8:Neurology and Neurosurgery"", ""catheter"", ""bleeding"", ""brain cortex"", ""aortic balloon"", ""carotid artery flow"", ""hemorrhagic shock"", ""infusion fluid"", ""pig"", ""resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion"", ""intracranial hypertension"", ""skull"", ""priority journal"", ""animal model"", ""female"", ""computer assisted tomography"", ""hypertensive factor -- drug therapy -- hypotension"", ""blood transfusion"", ""disease exacerbation"", ""disease course"", ""mean arterial pressure"", ""blood volume"", ""physiology"", ""animal experiment"", ""balloon occlusion"", ""hemodynamics"", ""traumatic brain injury -- therapy"", ""Conference Paper"", ""controlled study"", ""intracranial pressure"", ""aortic occlusion"", ""hypotension -- drug therapy -- hypertensive factor"", ""blood clotting"", ""porcine model"", ""multiple trauma"", ""animal tissue"", ""nonhuman"", ""hypertensive factor -- drug therapy"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""disease model"", ""hypotension -- drug therapy""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0000000000001518"", ""issn"": ""21630755"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Emergency Medicine, UC Davis Medical Center, 2315 Stockton Blvd., 4150 V St. Suite 2100, Sacramento, CA, 95817, United States, Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States ausjohnson@ucdavis.edu, Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States, Heart, Lung and Vascular Center, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States , Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States, Department of Surgery, UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA, United States, Department of Surgery, Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine, Miami Valley Hospital, Dayton, OH, United States , Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States, Department of Surgery, UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA, United States , Department of Radiology, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States , Department of Surgery, UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA, United States , Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States , Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States, Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States , Department of Emergency Medicine, UC Davis Medical Center, 2315 Stockton Blvd., 4150 V St. Suite 2100, Sacramento, CA, 95817, United States, Clinical Investigation Facility, David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, CA, United States, Johnson, M.

METHODS: Retrospective study (2005-2010) conducted at 6 institutions. Associations between leukodepletion and outcomes of mortality, infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) were modeled by logistic regression, and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS) in survivors was explored using linear regression. To examine trends over time, odds ratios (ORs) for outcomes of transfused were compared with nontransfused patients, including a comparison with nontransfused patients who were selected based on propensity score for RBC transfusion. RESULTS: We studied 14,980 patients, of whom 8857 (59%) had surgery pre-ULD. Transfusions of RBCs were made in 3799 (43%) pre-ULD, and 2525 (41%) post-ULD. Administration of exclusively leukodepleted, versus exclusively nonleukodepleted, RBCs was associated with lower incidence of AKI (adjusted OR 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.98, P = .035), but no difference in mortality or infection. For post-ULD patients, no difference was found in mortality (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76-1.22, P = .76) or infection (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.03, P = .161); however, AKI was reduced (OR 0.79 95% CI 0.68-0.92, P = .003). However, ORs for post-ULD outcomes were not significantly different in nontransfused, versus transfused, patients. Furthermore, those who received exclusively nonleukodepleted RBCs were more likely to have surgery post-ULD.

METHODS: A secondary analysis of a multicenter trial of vitamin C and E supplementation in healthy low-risk nulliparous women. Outcomes were compared between women with SPTB (due to spontaneous membrane rupture or labor) and those with IPTB (due to medical or obstetric complications). A primary maternal composite outcome included: death, pulmonary edema, blood transfusion, adult respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), cerebrovascular accident, acute tubular necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or liver rupture. A neonatal composite outcome included: neonatal death, RDS, grades III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS: Of 9,867 women, 10.4% (N = 1,038) were PTBs; 32.7% (n = 340) IPTBs and 67.3% (n = 698) SPTBs.

We hypothesized that DIC with increased fibrinolysis during the early stage of isolated traumatic brain injury (iTBI) affects the outcome of the patients and that hypoperfusion contributes to hyperfibrinolysis in the DIC. METHODS: This retrospective study included 92 patients with iTBI who were divided into DIC and non-DIC groups according to the Japanese Association Acute Medicine DIC scoring system. The DIC patients were subdivided into those with and without hyperfibrinolysis. The platelet counts and global markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were measured. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ dysfunction (assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score), tissue hypoperfusion (assessed by the lactate levels) and the transfusion volume were also evaluated. The outcome measure was all-cause hospital mortality. RESULTS: DIC patients showed consumption coagulopathy, lower antithrombin levels and higher fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer levels than non-DIC patients. All of the DIC patients developed SIRS accompanied by organ dysfunction and required higher blood transfusion volumes, leading to a worse outcome than non-DIC patients. These changes were more prominent in DIC with hyperfibrinolysis. A higher FDP/D-dimer ratio suggests that DIC belongs to the fibrinolytic phenotype and involves fibrin(ogen)olysis. The mean blood pressures of the patients with and without DIC on arrival were identical. Hypoperfusion and the lactate levels were not identified as independent predictors of hyperfibrinolysis.

9b8bac89-ec61-4e45-a801-0a3862d7139c,What do we know about the use of tranexamic acid in pediatric cardiac surgery?,"['Faraoni, D.', 'Van Der Linden, P.']",Transfusion Alternatives in Transfusion Medicine,12,1,39,"Introduction: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is the only available antifibrinolytic agent in Europe. The efficacy of this agent to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirement is well established in adults. However, risks, benefits and doses schemes are not clearly defined in the pediatric population. Until now, different meta-analysis exist but they include different antifibrinolytic agents; so far the large variability in patients studied, procedures, methods, and dosing schemes makes an analysis of the literature impractical. The goal of our analysis was to review the actual literature and define our actual knowledge about the use of TXA in pediatric population. Methods: A systematic search of all randomized controlled trials using TXA during pediatric cardiac surgery was conducted. Number of patient, mean age, mean weight, TXA dose and regimen of administration, cardiopulmonary bypass time, sternal closure time, volume of blood loss, red blood cell (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusion (PLT) at 24 hour, platelet count and fibrinogen at 24 hour, type of surgery were extracted from the different studies and then analyzed. Results: Seven studies were included in our analysis, and 689 patients were studied (379 in the TXA group, 310 in the Placebo group). Blood loss (mL/kg) at 24 hour postoperative is too heterogeneously distributed to be evaluated. TXA reduced significantly the need for RBC, FFP and PLT transfusion. Placebo was associated with an increase in the ECC time by about only 2.15 minute (95% CI [-4.17, -0.12]). Other outcomes were too heterogeneously distributed to be interpreted. A subgroup analysis evaluates specifically cyanotic and non-cyanotic patients. In non-cyanotic patients, TXA did not significantly decrease the perioperative blood loss. In cyanotic patients, the results were too heterogeneously distributed to be interpreted. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis show that the real benefit of TXA in reducing blood loss during pediatric cardiac surgery is not clearly demonstrated. Possible side effects of the use of TXA are poorly reported. Randomized controlled trials are too heterogeneous to give recommendations on the systematic use of tranexamic acid. Also, the best dose cannot be evaluate with this analyze and further studies are needed to explore other outcomes such as re-exploration, extubation time, side effects, length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit, and mortality.",2011/04//,Blackwell Publishing,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013060163?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013060163; 70586396"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""bleeding"", ""fibrinogen"", ""heart surgery"", ""meta analysis"", ""transfusion"", ""extubation"", ""fresh frozen plasma"", ""thrombocyte count"", ""patient"", ""tranexamic acid"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""cardiopulmonary bypass"", ""intensive care unit"", ""hospital"", ""human"", ""placebo"", ""side effect"", ""Europe"", ""weight"", ""randomized controlled trial (topic)"", ""antifibrinolytic agent"", ""population"", ""erythrocyte"", ""mortality"", ""length of stay"", ""risk"", ""adult"", ""surgery""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1778-428X.2011.01149.x"", ""issn"": ""12959022"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Anesthesiology, CHU-Brugmann - HUDERF, Brussels, Belgium , Department of Anesthesiology, CHU-Brugmann - HUDERF, Brussels, Belgium, Faraoni, D., Department of Anesthesiology, CHU-Brugmann - HUDERF, Brussels, Belgium"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 12th Annual NATA Symposium"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2011-11-24"", ""Date revised - 2011-11-25"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Transfusion+Alternatives+in+Transfusion+Medicine&rft.atitle=What+do+we+know+about+the+use+of+tranexamic+acid+in+pediatric+cardiac+surgery%3F&rft.au=Faraoni%2C+D.&rft.aulast=Faraoni&rft.aufirst=D.&rft.date=2011-04-01&rft.volume=12&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=39&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion+Alternatives+in+Transfusion+Medicine&rft.issn=12959022&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fj.1778-428X.2011.01149.x"", ""date"": ""Apr 2011""}"

The smallest and least mature infants tend to receive the largest amount of transfusions. RBC transfusion itself has also been suggested as an independent risk factor of poor clinical outcome in critical patients. Our aim is to study if there are associations between RBC transfusion and in-hospital mortality, short-term morbidities, and late neurodevelopmental outcome in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) preterm infants. Methods A cohort of ELBW preterm infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit from January 2009 to December 2010 were recruited. The number of RBC transfusions within 7 days, 30 days, and 60 days of life were recorded. Clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality, development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, and later neurodevelopmental outcome were assessed with follow-up of up to 2 years of age. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between RBC transfusion and clinical outcomes. Results A total of 98 ELBW preterm infants survived at the time of discharge. Of these survivors, the mean numbers of RBC transfusions were 2.5 ± 1.7, 7.4 ± 3.1, and 11.3 ± 4.5 times within 7 days, 30 days, and 60 days after birth, respectively. The number of transfusions within 7 days of life was correlated with risk of death before 1 month of age (odds ratio: 1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–2.27, p = 0.03) and the number of transfusions within 30 days was correlated with risk of developing threshold ROP (odds ratio: 1.27, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–1.55, p = 0.02). The number of transfusions within 7 days of life was positively correlated with cognitive performance (Mental Developmental Index score) at 18–24 months of corrected age. Conclusion RBC transfusion has a negative impact on survival in ELBW infants. It increases the risk of developing ROP and affects late neurodevelopment.

We report the usefulness and problems of a new device-Solcotrans Plus, which only requires connection to wall suction. This device consists of three parts: suction, reservoir bag, and filter for autoinfusion. After setting the suction and reservoir bag primed with anticoagulant, ACD or heparin, and connecting the unit to a wall suction, we performed autotransfusion of shed blood through the filtration component in ICU after operation.

This is often also accompanied by increased neonatal morbidity. Use of fetal pillow (FP) to elevate the fetal head prior to a CSFD has been reported recently. Methods The study was conducted in a teaching hospital in West of India during a 12-month period. Patients requiring a CSFD were randomized either to FP n = 100 or no FP n = 102 use. IRB approval was obtained for the study. Results The two groups were similar as regarding gestation, parity, age, length of labour, indications and fetal weight. Patients in the FP arm had significantly shorter operating time (<0.001) and incision to delivery interval (<0.001), uterine extensions were much lower in the FP arm (0.001) along with a lower incidence of blood loss more than 1L (<0.001) and need for blood transfusion (0.007). Admission to NICU was similar in both groups, there was one skull fracture and two neonatal deaths and three neonates with convulsions in the control arm and none in the FP arm, however due to small numbers this did not reach statistical significance.

Bleeding predisposes to mortality, sepsis, allosensitization, and right ventricular failure. We present results of an integrated approach to reduce bleeding complications. Analysis of 51 implantable LVADs implanted in 50 patients (mean age 52 years; male, 45; Intragency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support [INTERMACS] 1 or 2, 25) in our center in 2008 and 2009, including 15 reoperations. Preoperative coagulopathy was evident in 10 patients. Our strategy included: early LVAD implantation, preoperative nutritional support and hemodynamic optimization, preferential use of continuous flow LVADs, meticulous surgical hemostasis, liberal application of tricuspid annuloplasty, and blood product utilization based on point-of-care testing. Two patients (4%) were reexplored for bleeding. Median transfusion rates intraoperatively were: blood: 2 units (interquartile range [IQR] 0-4); plasma: 0 units (0-2.75); platelets: 0 pools (0-1.75), while postoperative transfusion rates for first 48h were blood: 1 unit (0-2); plasma: 0 units (0-0.75); and platelets: 0 pools (0,1). Right ventricular assist device was utilized in six patients (11%). Median chest tube drainage in first 24h was 1230mL (IQR 862-1687). Median time on ventilator was 2 days, intensive care unit was 6 days, and hospitalization was 18 days. Hospital mortality was 20%. Using an integrated approach, we have experienced bleeding and transfusion rates similar to that seen in non-LVAD complex cardiac operations. The potential to reduce bleeding reduces invasiveness of LVAD surgery, reduces allosensitization, may improve outcomes, and may increase mainstream acceptability of LVADs as definitive therapy for heart failure. © 2012, the Authors.

STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial. PATIENT POPULATION: Sixty-nine normovolemic critically ill patients admitted to one of five tertiary level intensive care units with hemoglobin values less than 90 g/L within 72 hours of admission. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated to one of two RBC transfusion strategies. Hemoglobin values were maintained between 100 and 120 g/L in the liberal transfusion group and between 70 and 90 g/L in the restrictive group. RESULTS: Primary diagnosis and mean +/- SD age (58.6 +/- 15 vs 59.0 +/- 21 years and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (20 +/- 6.2 vs 21 +/- 7.2) were similar in the restrictive and liberal groups, respectively. Daily hemoglobin values averaged 90 g/L in the restrictive group vs 109 g/L in the liberal group (P < .001). The restrictive group received 2.5 U per patient compared with 4.8 U per patient in the liberal group. This represents a 48% relative decrease (P < .001) in RBC units transfused per patient. The 30-day mortality rate was 24% in the restrictive group compared with 25% in the liberal group; the 95% confidence interval around the absolute difference was -19% to 21%. Similar observations were noted for intensive care unit mortality (P = .76) and 120-day mortality (P > .99). In addition, survival analysis comparing time until death in both groups did not reveal any significant difference (P = .93) between groups. Organ dysfunction scores were also similar (P = .44). CONCLUSION: In this small randomized trial, neither mortality nor the development of organ dysfunction was affected by the transfusion strategy, which suggests that a more restrictive approach to the transfusion of RBCs may be safe in critically ill patients. However, the study lacked power to detect small but clinically significant differences. Therefore, further investigations of RBC transfusion strategies are warranted.",1995,United States,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1995.03520420055038,"{""pmid"": 7723158, ""print_issn"": ""0098-7484"", ""linking_issn"": ""0098-7484"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""7501160"", ""publication_types"": [""Clinical Trial"", ""Journal Article"", ""Multicenter Study"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""APACHE"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""standards"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Canada"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Care"", ""qualifier"": ""standards"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Illness"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Illness"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemoglobins"", ""qualifier"": ""analysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Multiple Organ Failure"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pilot Projects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Survival Analysis"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""1995 May 10"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""1995-05-10""}}"

Although plasma transfusion is common in intensive care, there are no data on plasma transfusion practices in pediatric critical care units. Study Design and Methods A scenario-based survey was sent to 718 pediatric critical care physicians working in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Respondents were asked to report their decisions regarding plasma transfusion practice with respect to four scenarios: pneumonia, septic shock, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and postoperative care after a Tetralogy of Fallot correction. Results The response rate was 187 of 718 (26%); half of the responders worked in North America. The proportion of physicians who transfused plasma to nonbleeding patients, solely based on abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), varied from 66% for pneumonia to 84% for TBI (p < 0.001). In such nonbleeding patients, the median INR threshold that would trigger plasma transfusion was 2.5 for pneumonia and septic shock patients and 2.0 for TBI and the cardiac postoperative patients (p < 0.001). Minor bleeding, minor surgery, insertion of a femoral line, hypotension, abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombocytopenia, and anemia levels were important determinants of plasma transfusion, whereas none of the respondents' demographic characteristics were important.

DESIGN: Retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing OPCAB surgery. SETTING: University teaching hospital. Tertiary care referral center for cardiac surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred seventy-two consecutive male and female patients undergoing OPCAB surgery. There were 110 women and 262 men. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gender, duration of tracheal intubation, units of blood transfused, ICULOS, PLOS, and LOS were collected from the records of patients undergoing OPCAB surgery at the authors' institution over a period of 16 months. There were a total of 372 patients: 110 women and 262 men. Median intubation time was 4.5 hours for women and 4.0 hours for men (p = 0.749); 59.1% of women received red blood cells versus 31.3% of men (p < 0.001).

However, a number of laboratory and observational studies have indicated that the amount of time RBCs are stored has an impact on O2 delivery to tissues. Consequently, older RBCs may result in higher rates of organ dysfunction, nosocomial infection, and lengths of stay. Because of potential harmful effects, an evaluation of the association between age of blood and nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction is warranted. Methods: ARIPI is a double‐blind, randomized controlled trial conducted at six tertiary care NICUs across Canada. The trial will be an effectiveness study evaluating the effectiveness of stored versus fresh RBCs in neonates requiring transfusion. Neonatal patients requiring at least one unit of RBCs will be randomized to receive either: 1) RBCs stored no longer than seven days; or 2) standard practice. All blood products will be supplied by the hospital blood bank. The primary outcome for this study will be a composite measure of major neonatal morbidities (necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dyspalsia, and intraventricular hemorrhage). Secondary outcomes will include individual items of the composite measure, nosocomial infection (bacteremia, septic shock, and pneumonia), and mortality. Results: A total of 340 infants of an expected 370 have been enrolled to date. Aggregate baseline characteristics and outcomes will be presented. Conclusion: As no randomized clinical trials have been conducted assessing the clinical effectiveness of fresh versus stored RBCs, the purported benefits of fresh blood remain unknown.

Methods: The clinical data of 465 patients who underwent OPCABG with a median chest incision were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into the observation group (with DSWI, 32 cases) and the control group (without DSWI, 433 cases) according to the occurrence of DSWI. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical data relevant to DSWI were collected in both groups. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were adopted to analyze the risk factors for DSWI after OPCABG and investigateand its prevention and treatment strategy. Results: DSWI occurred in 32 cases with an incidence of infection of 6.89%. There were 5 cases died in the observation group (with DSWI), the overall mortality rate was 1.07% and the intra-group mortality rate was 15.6%. There were 16 cases died in the control group (without DSWI) because of low cardiac output syndrome and multiple organ failure, the overall and intra-group mortality rates were 3.44% and 3.69% respectively. By analyzing the risk factors of DSWI between the two groups, the differences in age, body mass index (BMI), history of diabetes mellitus (DM), operation time, tracheal intubation time, time of stay in thecardiac care unit, blood transfusion (blood plasma)>800mL, blood transfusion (erythrocyte suspension)>6um, secondary thoracotomy were statistically significant between the observation and control groups (P < 0.05 in all). Conclusion: Obesity, history of DM, prolonged operation time and tracheal intubation time, time of stay in CCU, utilization of blood product and secondary thoracotomy were DSWI independent risk factors after OPCABG.Some preventive measure should been implemented to reduce the incidence of DSWI, such as shorter operation time and tracheal intubation time, reducing the utilization of blood product.",2022,Dove Medical Press Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2713698189?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2713698189; 2017931202"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting"", ""risk factor"", ""sternal wound infection"", ""dobutamine"", ""34368-04-2"", ""52663-81-7"", ""49745-95-1"", ""61661-06-1"", ""dopamine"", ""51-61-6"", ""62-31-7"", ""Embase"", ""18:Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Surgery"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""dobutamine -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- aged"", ""deep sternal wound infection -- prevention"", ""medical history"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""body mass"", ""deep sternal wound infection -- complication"", ""forward heart failure"", ""operation duration"", ""antilipemic agent -- drug therapy"", ""observational study"", ""plasma transfusion"", ""antibiotic agent -- drug therapy -- postoperative infection"", ""treatment duration"", ""dopamine -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""sternotomy"", ""cardiac care unit"", ""postoperative infection -- complication"", ""postoperative infection -- drug therapy"", ""intensive care unit"", ""endotracheal intubation"", ""female"", ""obesity"", ""dopamine -- drug therapy"", ""off pump coronary surgery"", ""dobutamine -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- aged"", ""human cell"", ""ischemic heart disease -- drug therapy -- dopamine"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""multiple organ failure"", ""postoperative infection -- prevention"", ""incision"", ""postoperative infection -- drug therapy -- antibiotic agent"", ""antilipemic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""adult"", ""surgical infection -- complication"", ""antilipemic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- aged"", ""male"", ""retrospective study"", ""ischemic heart disease -- drug therapy -- antilipemic agent"", ""death"", ""Article"", ""dopamine -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- aged"", ""antibiotic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- aged"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""dual antiplatelet therapy"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- drug therapy"", ""clinical article"", ""antibiotic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""ischemic heart disease -- drug therapy -- dobutamine"", ""thoracotomy"", ""morbidity"", ""human"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- drug therapy -- ischemic heart disease"", ""dobutamine -- drug therapy -- ischemic heart disease"", ""human tissue"", ""aged"", ""low drug dose"", ""mortality rate"", ""antibiotic agent -- drug therapy"", ""controlled study"", ""ischemic heart disease -- drug therapy -- antithrombocytic agent"", ""ischemic heart disease -- drug therapy"", ""antilipemic agent -- drug therapy -- ischemic heart disease"", ""dopamine -- drug therapy -- ischemic heart disease"", ""length of stay"", ""surgical infection -- prevention"", ""dobutamine -- drug therapy"", ""age""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S381422"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, China songyanyanyys60@126.com, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, China, Song, Yanyan, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, No. 804 Shengli South Street, Xingqing District, Yinchuan, 750004, China"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2022-09-27"", ""Date revised - 2022-09-27"", ""Number of references - 21"", ""Last updated - 2022-09-27""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Infection+and+Drug+Resistance&rft.atitle=Analysis+of+Risk+Factors+for+Sternal+Wound+Infection+After+Off-Pump+Coronary+Artery+Bypass+Grafting&rft.au=Yang%2C+Jian&rft.aulast=Yang&rft.aufirst=Jian&rft.date=2022-01-01&rft.volume=15&rft.issue=&rft.spage=5249&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Infection+and+Drug+Resistance&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.2147%2FIDR.S381422"", ""date"": ""2022""}"

We assessed platelet count and function during and after paediatric cardiac surgery. Secondary aims included the effect of modified ultrafiltration, identification of factors associated with platelet dysfunction, and to assess associations between platelet function and transfusion requirements. Methods Fifty-seven patients were included in a prospective observational study. Platelet count and platelet function (multiple-electrode impedance aggregometry) were analysed before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), after modified ultrafiltration, on arrival at the intensive care unit, and on the first postoperative day. Intraoperative transfusions of blood products were registered. Results Both platelet count and platelet aggregation were markedly reduced during surgery with the greatest reduction at the end of CPB. On postoperative day 1, platelet count was still reduced by 50%, while platelet aggregation had returned to - or above - preoperative levels. There were only moderate correlations between platelet count and platelet aggregation. Modified ultrafiltration had no significant influence on platelet count or aggregation. Young age, low weight, and long operation time were associated with poor platelet aggregation during surgery, while young age, low weight, high preoperative haemoglobin levels, and low preoperative platelet count were associated with poor aggregation after operation. Patients with impaired platelet function during CPB had markedly increased intraoperative transfusion requirements. Conclusions Platelet count and platelet aggregation are markedly reduced during and immediately after paediatric cardiac surgery, especially in neonates.

Methods: A retrospective observational study of admissions to three intensive care units (ICU) in the UK. We identified thrombocytopaenic patients who received a platelet transfusion and extracted the platelet count prior and subsequent to platelet transfusion. We grouped patients with or without suspected bone marrow failure, defined by a total white cell count ≤1.0 × 109/L. Results: Of 11,757 admissions, 399 (3.4%) patients received a platelet transfusion for thrombocytopaenia.

306d3ac4-e20c-44fd-8ba7-ad7b84b5f996,Management of transfusion reactions in neonatal period,"['Azarkeivan, Azita']",Iranian Journal of Blood and Cancer,9,3,8-9,"Neonatal period is defined as infants up to 28 days after birth. The most common group of neonates who are indicated to receive blood transfusion are LBW or preterm infants who are admitted in NICU. The other indications of blood transfusion in older infants and children are : critical conditions in those who are admitted in ICU, the probability of cardiac surgery, congenital anemia such as thalassaemia major and patients with malignancy who receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Nowadays, modern blood transfusion services are very safe, but still we may encounter some transfusion reactions. The most commonly observed transfusion reactions are immune mediated followed by non immune mediated transfusion reactions. The immune mediated transfusion reactions include: Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions mostly due to ABO incompatibility (Clerical error), Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction due to alloimmunization against RBC minor antigens, Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions due to leukocyte antigens and allergic reactions due to antibodies in recipient against plasma proteins in donor's blood. Non immune transfusion reactions are as follow: volume overload, bacterial contamination, transfusion-transmitted infections, electrolyte imbalance, hypothermia, iron overload and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions including identification errors (patients' blood samples and blood components) by hospital staff are the most common cause of the “wrong blood into patient” events. In such situations, the first step is that the transfusion should be stopped and the patient be assessed clinically and resuscitation should be considered if necessary. The further steps are: To check the details on the patient's ID band, documents and records such as results of the compatibility tests, call for medical assistance and contact the blood bank to recheck the blood unit. Immune-mediated delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by antibody production against Rh allels, Kell, Duffy or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular hemolysis, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions; however, this event is uncommon in children. Antigen negative blood unit is the treatment option of this situation. Non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions caused by cytokines from leukocytes in transfused blood bag is defined as a temperature elevation of 1°C from the basal temperature. The cause of fever due to other problems such as infections should be excluded. Leukoreduced blood units decreased the chance of this transfusion reaction. Allergic reactions typically present as rash, urticaria and are IgE-mediated and are caused by allogeneic proteins existing in donor's plasma. Washed RBC is used in cases with repeated allergic transfusion reactions. Among non immunologic transfusion reactions, circulatory overload occurs when the volume of the transfused blood is high which will will be decreased by use of PRBC or use of diuretics. Bacterial contamination and endotoxemia may result from inadequate sterile preparation of the phlebotomy site or opening the blood container in a nonsterile environment or possibility of entry of bacteria into the donor's blood bag. Transfusion-transmitted infection is now a rare event but is not zero yet. Electrolyte imbalance and hypothermia is an inevitable event, but can be decreased by using appropriate components. Iron overload is another complication of blood transfusion in multiply transfused patients.

The highest mean value (16.6 mg. /100 ml.) was reached on the 6th day. A correlation was found to exist between the serum bilirubin level in the first 48 hr. and the maximum level reached: if the former rose to above 10 mg. /100 ml. the latter could be expected to exceed 20 mg. /100 ml. No correlation was found between the weight at delivery and the maximum elevation of the serum bilirubin. Neither the increase of bilirubin nor the development of encephalopathy is presented by the administration of ACTH. Brain damage can be prevented only by exchange transfusion which should be performed immediately if signs of encephalopathy appear. When the serum bilirubin rises above 20 mg. / 100 ml. the incidence of brain damage rises in proportion. A serum bilirubin of mere than 25 mg./iOO ml. is an indication in itself for exchange transfusion.

Small patients especially neonates react sensitively to the negative impact of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). High transfusion requirements and rather extensive costs for clotting factors post bypass may often be necessary. We, therefore, investigated a hyperfibrinolysis prophylaxis (HFP) with tranexamic acid (TXA) and evaluated possible effects of our concept in a retrospective study. Methods: HFP started in November 2015 for all surgical patients with continuous infusion of 4 mg/kgBW/h of TXA after induction of anesthesia. Our study compares 136 patients with a bodyweight below 10 kg who received TXA to 123 patients without TXA operated before November 2015. We analyzed demographic data, CPB data and outcomes, as well as transfusion requirements. (Figure Presented) Results: Both groups had similar preoperative, demographic data, and laboratory values. There were distinct advantages for TXA-patients, correlating with improved clotting function post bypass. Starting with markedly shorter surgery- (315 ± 136 vs. 351 ± 124 minutes) and CPB-reperfusion (38 ± 28 vs. 47 ± 37 minutes) up to shorter postoperative ventilation (6.3 ± 12.2 vs. 7.8 ± 17.2 hours, P = 0.1) and ICU treatment (10.4 ± 21.3 vs. 12.2 ± 23.0 days; P = .25). TXA-patients showed a significant decrease in transfused volume and the need for blood products (PRBC, FFP, PC, PPSB, rFVIIa) between 28% and 90% of the amounts applied. These costs were effectively halved by TXA. Conclusion: Although the use of TXA in children may be far away from supported recommendations, the routine application of TXA in pediatric cardiac surgery was associated with significantly decreased transfusion requirements. Shorter postoperative ventilation and earlier discharge from the ICU are associated with marked cost savings.",2020,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2396011384?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2396011384; 631570595"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""recombinant blood clotting factor 7a"", ""897936-89-9"", ""944130-77-2"", ""1360054-92-7"", ""1228539-24-9"", ""1600492-21-4"", ""tranexamic acid"", ""1197-18-8"", ""701-54-2"", ""Embase"", ""preoperative evaluation"", ""surgical patient"", ""drug therapy"", ""artificial ventilation"", ""heart surgery"", ""major clinical study"", ""prophylaxis"", ""body weight"", ""cost control"", ""anesthesia induction"", ""controlled study"", ""demography"", ""blood clotting"", ""cardiopulmonary bypass"", ""conference abstract"", ""female"", ""human"", ""reperfusion"", ""male"", ""retrospective study"", ""child""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aor.13674"", ""issn"": ""15251594"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany, WKK Perfusionsservice, Mainz, Germany , Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany , Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany , Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany, WKK Perfusionsservice, Mainz, Germany, Teske, Andreas, Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital Erlangen, Germany"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 16th International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2020-04-29"", ""Date revised - 2020-04-29"", ""Last updated - 2020-04-29""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Artificial+Organs&rft.atitle=Evaluation+of+an+antihyperfibrinolysis+regimen+in+pediatric+cardiac+surgery&rft.au=Teske%2C+Andreas&rft.aulast=Teske&rft.aufirst=Andreas&rft.date=2020-01-01&rft.volume=44&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=E185&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Artificial+Organs&rft.issn=15251594&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Faor.13674"", ""date"": ""2020""}"

The aim of the present work was to estimate the incidence of CVC-linked thrombosis, among neonates in the NICU of Alexandria University Maternity Hospital, Egypt, over 1year, and to determine its possible risk factors. METHODS: This observational cohort study involved 134 newborn infants born from July 2020 to July 2021with CVCs insertion during their hospital stay. Patients who had congenital anomalies, had thrombosis unrelated to the implantation of CVCs or died before 7 days of catheter placement were excluded from the analysis. The 134 neonates who met the study's eligibility requirements had 142 CVCs inserted. Serial ultrasound and Doppler scans on site of venous insertion of catheters were performed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with catheter's thrombosis (12%) were found during the placement of 142 catheters or 1615 CVCs' days, resulting in an overall rate of 10.5 thrombotic events per 1000 catheters' days. We constructed a logistic regression model to identify risk factors behind CVC-linked thrombosis. In univariate analysis, femoral central venous lines (CVLs), catheter dwell-time, sepsis, packed red cells (PRBCs) transfusions and low platelet count were risk factors for CVC-linked thrombosis. Nevertheless, only PRBCs transfusion was significant in the multivariate analysis, with OR and 95% confidence level 5.768 (1.013-32.836).

The procedure is associated with complications. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical features and etiologies of infants with hyperbiliru-binemia who underwent exchange transfusion and evaluate the adverse events and clinical outcomes. Material and Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the multicenter Turkish Neonatal Jaundice Online Registry data. Otherwise healthy newborns born ≥35 weeks of gestation who were hospitalized for jaundice and underwent exchange transfusion were included. Results: One-hundred thirty-two patients with a mean serum bilirubin level on admission of 24.9±9.1 mg/dL were enrolled in the study. The most common cause for exchange transfusion was hemolytic jaundice (63.6%), followed by lack of proper feeding (12.9%). It was found that the infants with lack of proper feeding were discharged earlier from the maternity ward (p=0.02), but they were admitted to hospital later (p<0.001) with a higher bilirubin level (p=0.001), and geater weight loss (p=0.04). The reported rate of adverse events associated with exchange transfusion was 11.4%. The most common complication was thrombocytopenia (40%). None of the infants died during the procedure. Acute bilirubin encephalopathy was reported in 13 (9.8%) patients. Conclusion: Severe hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion and acute bilirubin encephalopathy are still challenging problems in neonatal periodin our country. The policies including blood group analysis of pregnant women, programs informing parents about breast-feeding and jaundice, and monitoring bilirubin levels of high-risk newborns should be developed to reduce the necessitating for exchange transfusion and to avoid related complications.",2021,,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2548676109?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2548676109; 2007644506"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Complication"", ""Exchange transfusion"", ""Hyperbilirubinemia"", ""Newborn"", ""bilirubin"", ""18422-02-1"", ""635-65-4"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""Embase"", ""29:Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry"", ""7:Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency"", ""reticulocyte count"", ""polycythemia"", ""blood group ABO incompatibility"", ""necrotizing enterocolitis -- complication"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""breast feeding"", ""major clinical study"", ""Article"", ""exchange blood transfusion"", ""hearing impairment -- complication"", ""neonatal hyperbilirubinemia -- drug therapy -- fresh frozen plasma"", ""infant"", ""bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction score"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- drug therapy"", ""newborn hemolytic disease"", ""sepsis -- complication"", ""gestational age"", ""thrombocytopenia -- complication"", ""bilirubin -- endogenous compound"", ""female"", ""neonatal hyperbilirubinemia -- drug therapy"", ""hospitalization"", ""Turkey (republic)"", ""rhesus incompatibility"", ""jaundice"", ""kernicterus -- complication"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- drug therapy -- neonatal hyperbilirubinemia"", ""newborn"", ""body weight loss"", ""clinical feature"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- pediatric patient"", ""hypocalcemia -- complication"", ""infant feeding"", ""clinical outcome"", ""neonatal intensive care unit"", ""prospective study"", ""albumin -- endogenous compound"", ""multicenter study"", ""fresh frozen plasma -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""male""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.14744/TurkPediatriArs.2020.65983"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey emelokulu@gmail.com, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Yüzüncü Yıl University, Faculty of Medicine, Van, Turkey , Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine, Diyarbakır, Turkey , Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Marmara University, Faculty of Medicine, İstanbul, Turkey , Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Trakya University, Faculty of Medicine, Edirne, Turkey , Department of Neonatology, Dr. Sami Ulus Gynecology Obstetrics and Child Health and Diseases Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey , Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey, Okulu, Emel, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-11-10"", ""Date revised - 2022-04-12"", ""Number of references - 38"", ""Last updated - 2022-04-12""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Turkish+Archives+of+Pediatrics&rft.atitle=Exchange+transfusion+for+neonatal+hyperbilirubinemia%3A+A+multicenter%2C+prospective+study+of+turkish+neonatal+society&rft.au=Okulu%2C+Emel&rft.aulast=Okulu&rft.aufirst=Emel&rft.date=2021-01-01&rft.volume=56&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=121&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Turkish+Archives+of+Pediatrics&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.14744%2FTurkPediatriArs.2020.65983"", ""date"": ""2021""}"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors that could affect the outcome. Methods: From 01/2017 to 10/2018, 47 patients (26 females-21 males), aged between 43 and 83 years underwent major resections (>3 segments) due to cancer (primary or metastatic). All patients had normal liver parenchyma or cirrhosis Pugh - Child's A. Pre and postoperative liver biochemistry and coagulation markers were analyzed. We evaluated the presence of hypothermia and shock, lactic acid values, the number of transfusions and the outcome. Results: At the time of ICU admission the majority of patients were hypothermic, no one received vasopressors and 8 of them remained intubated. No significant coagulation abnormalities pre- or posthepatectomy were observed (Table 1). Twenty-eight patients did not receive any transfusion (Group A), the rest 19 patients (Group B) were transfused intraoperatively (average 2.5 RBC). Postoperatively the transfused patients had higher levels of LDH, bilirubin, serum lactate and needed more time to normalize the lactate value (Table 2). Posthepatectomy mortality was 2.1%. Conclusions: Advanced age and primary or metastatic disease do not affect the morbidity and mortality.

Study Design In 2013, the SMI convened interprofessional workgroups on hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and hypertension tasked with developing evidence-based care bundles. Participating hospitals submitted data measured before, during, and after implementation of the hemorrhage bundle: maternal mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, cardiovascular collapse, hysterectomy, and transfusion of ≥4 units of red blood cells (RBCs). Data were analyzed for trends stratified by implementation status. Results Of the 123 maternity hospitals in NYS, 117 participated, of which 113 submitted data. Of 250,719 births, transfusion of ≥4 units RBCs (1.8 per 1,000) and ICU admissions (1.1 per 1,000) were the most common morbidities. Four hemorrhage-related maternal deaths (1.6 per 100,000) and 10 cases of cardiovascular collapse requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (4.0 per 100,000) occurred. Hemorrhage morbidity did not change over the five quarters studied. Risks were similar across hospital level of care and implementation status.

After 50 h of ECMO, his chest radiograph had dramatically improved, his oxygen need had been reduced to 50%, and he was successfully weaned from ECMO. Two years later, he is doing extremely well. Therefore, institution of ECMO using the femoral approach can be performed safely at the bedside in the ICU, and can be lifesaving in the context of a very severe reimplantation response after lung transplantation.",2000,"American College of Chest Physicians, 3300 Dundee Road, IL 60062-2348",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/691316261?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""691316261; 30637835"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"", ""Lung transplantation"", ""Pulmonary reimplantation response"", ""azathioprine"", ""446-86-6"", ""cyclosporin"", ""79217-60-0"", ""methylprednisolone"", ""6923-42-8"", ""83-43-2"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""15:Chest Diseases, Thoracic Surgery and Tuberculosis"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""immunosuppressive agent -- drug combination"", ""cyclosporin -- drug combination"", ""case report"", ""transfusion"", ""graft rejection -- prevention"", ""azathioprine -- drug therapy"", ""thymocyte antibody -- drug therapy"", ""thorax radiography"", ""ventilator"", ""patient"", ""reperfusion injury -- complication"", ""priority journal"", ""graft rejection -- complication"", ""oxygen"", ""human"", ""methylprednisolone -- drug therapy"", ""hypoxia"", ""chronic lung disease -- surgery"", ""cyclosporin -- drug therapy"", ""extracorporeal oxygenation"", ""graft rejection -- drug therapy"", ""methylprednisolone -- drug combination"", ""thymocyte antibody -- drug combination"", ""treatment outcome"", ""article"", ""reimplantation"", ""reperfusion injury -- therapy"", ""immunosuppressive agent -- drug therapy"", ""mortality"", ""thorax wall"", ""lung transplantation"", ""azathioprine -- drug combination"", ""emphysema -- surgery"", ""adult"", ""hematoma"", ""male""], ""issn"": ""00123692"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Verleden, G.M., Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2000-09-02"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-19"", ""Number of references - 12"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - CHETB""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Chest&rft.atitle=Femoral+venoarterial+extracorporeal+membrane+oxygenation+for+severe+reimplantation+response+after+lung+transplantation&rft.au=Vlasselaers%2C+Dirk&rft.aulast=Vlasselaers&rft.aufirst=Dirk&rft.date=2000-01-01&rft.volume=118&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=559&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Chest&rft.issn=00123692&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""2000""}"

BACKGROUND: RBC transfusions are common in critically ill children. Despite their benefits, observational studies suggest an association between them and HAIs. One possible mechanism for increased HAI is transfusion-related immunomodulation due to bioactive substances' release as transfused blood ages. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the 'Transfusion Requirement in Paediatric Intensive Care Units' (TRIPICU) study, we analysed a subset of 257 participants that received only one pre-storage leukoreduced RBC transfusion. RBC storage length was classified as 1) transfusion of 'fresh' RBCs (≤10 days), 2) transfusion of 'stored' RBCs (21-34 days), and 3) transfusion of 'long-stored' RBCs (≥35 days). All were compared to a 'golden' period (11-20 days), representing the time between 'fresh' and 'stored'. We used quasi-Poisson multivariable regression models to estimate the HAI incidence rate ratio (IRR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We found that the association between the length of storage time of leukoreduced RBCs and HAIs was not significant in the 'fresh' group (IRR 1.23; 95% CI 0.55, 2.78) and the 'stored' group (IRR 1.61; 95% CI 0.63, 4.13) when compared to the 'golden' period. However, we observed a statistically significant association between the 'long-stored' group and an increase in the HAI incidence rate (IRR 3.66; 95% CI 1.22, 10.98). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of leukoreduced RBC units stored for ≥35 days is associated with increased HAI incidence rate in haemodynamically stable, critically ill children.",2021,England,https://doi.org/10.1111/tme.12824,"{""pmid"": 34585466, ""electronic_issn"": ""1365-3148"", ""linking_issn"": ""0958-7578"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9301182"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Blood Preservation"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Child"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Critical Illness"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocytes"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hospitals"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Intensive Care Units, Pediatric"", ""major"": false}], ""keywords"": [""critically ill children"", ""hospital-acquired infections"", ""length of storage"", ""leukoreduction"", ""red blood cell transfusion"", ""secondary analysis""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2021 Dec"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2021-05-18"", ""accepted"": ""2021-09-08"", ""published"": ""2021-09-30"", ""electronic"": ""2021-09-28""}}"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of clopidogrel administration before coronary artery bypass grafting on patients using thromboresistant surfaces with low-dose heparin during surgical intervention. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between 2005 and 2009 were incorporated in this retrospective study. Of these, 52 (22.2%) received clopidogrel within 5 days before the operation, and 182 (77.8%) did not. Regression models determined the effect of clopidogrel on the rate of chest re-exploration because of bleeding, 24-hour chest tube output, perioperative blood product transfusion, length of stay, morbidity, and perioperative mortality. Hemorrhage-related preoperative risk factors, as well as those found to be significant in univariate models, were included in the multivariate model. RESULTS: Chest tube drainage was significantly increased during the first 24 hours after the operation in the clopidogrel group (679.7 ± 305.8 vs 516.6 ± 209.8 mL, P = .0007). The need for intraoperative blood product transfusion was similar; nevertheless, more patients receiving clopidogrel required fresh frozen plasma postoperatively (7.7% vs 1.1%, P = .0232). However, risk-adjusted logistic regression showed that exposure to clopidogrel was not a predictor of intraoperative or postoperative blood product transfusion. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were shorter in patients receiving clopidogrel.

METHODS: From September 2000 to February 2003, 279 consecutive patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with minimal extracorporeal circulation. A group of 243 patients at good risk as defined by a Euro- SCORE of 3 underwent complete bypass and blood cardioplegia, and a high-risk group of 45 patients (EuroSCORE, 6) underwent operations with partial assistance and a beating heart. In a prospective substudy analysis of thrombocyte and platelet counts, transfusion requirements, PaO2/FIO2, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, postoperative bleeding, intensive care unit stay, and ventilation, 40 patients from the good-risk group were matched and compared with 40 patients who underwent operations with a conventional extracorporeal system. RESULTS: Revascularization was complete with a mean of 2.8 distal anastomoses in the good-risk group and 2.4 in the high-risk group. Mortality rates were 1.2% and 4%, respectively. The system provided either complete or partial bypass assistance and depended on preload and afterload. The system also allowed easy access to all territories with perfect hemodynamic stability. Priming was reduced to 400 mL, and arterial and venous saturation monitoring revealed excellent maintenance of pH values. No complications or failure of the system occurred.

A novel iliac branch endoprosthesis (IBE) is commercially available with encouraging initial result. Our objective was to compare perioperative outcomes of patients with iliac aneurysms treated by open (OS) versus endovascular repair with IBE. Methods: Retrospective single-center review of patients treated for aortoiliac or isolated common and/or internal iliac artery aneurysms from 2014-2017. Patients with connective tissue disorders, infected or thoracoabdominal aneurysms were excluded. Primary outcomes were perioperative mortality, length of hospital (LOS) and ICU stay, estimated blood loss (EBL), need for red blood cell transfusion (RBC) and perioperative reinterventions. Results: 70 patients (96% male) were treated with OS (N=26, mean age 68±8 years) or IBE (N=44, mean age 73±8 years; P=0.02) with one symptomatic patient in each group. Perioperative mortality occurred in one patient in the OS group (3.8%), with no mortality in the IBE group (P=NS). Total length of hospital stay was higher for OS (7.5±3.4 days versus 1.9±1.5 day for IBE, P<.0001). Additionally, ICU stay was higher for OS (3.3±2.1 days versus 0.2±0.6 days for IBE group, P<.0001). EBL was higher for patients undergoing OS (4627±2597mL) compared to patients treated with IBE (258±447mL; P<.0001), with higher RBC transfusion requirements in patients treated with OS (1.5±2.4 versus 0.2±0.8 units; P=0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2018 and August 2021, 90 adult patients who underwent for TAAD were included. Primary outcome measures were postoperative bleeding amount and blood product transfusion requirements. Two different protocols performed in TAAD surgery in our clinic. In this pre- and postimplementation study, before October 2019, the standard-dose heparin protocol (SH group) was used and after November 2019, the low-dose heparin protocol (LH group) was used and two groups were compared. Mechanical ventilation duration, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, postoperative drainage volumes, blood product transfusions, reoperations due to bleeding, and in-hospital mortality rates were recorded. RESULTS: The dosages of heparin and activated clotting time values, as well as the additional heparin requirement, were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.001). Standard-dose heparinization was needed only in 33.3% of patients in the LH group. In the SH group, postoperative total drainage and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion were significantly higher than the LH group (p = 0.036 and p = 0.046, respectively).

fc649cc8-02a8-405b-a9e0-05866f8c453c,Clinical success of granulocyte transfusions in adult neutropenic patients after chemotherapy and/or allogeneic transplantation-time matters!,"['Inkari Thies, Kira', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Stölzel, Friedrich', 'Bornhäuser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Von Bonin, Simone', 'Schneider, Ralph', 'Hölig, Kristina']",Bone Marrow Transplantation,55,,271,"Background: For decades, granulocyte transfusions (GTX) have been performed to treat neutropenic haematological patients with infectious complications. Nevertheless, the clinical efficacy of this cellular therapy is remaining controversial. Methods: We performed a risk factor analysis in a large cohort of patients who received GTX between 2004 and 2014 at the University Hospital Dresden. Demographical data, diagnosis and outcome of the patients were registered. Among other parameters, type and state of the infection, dosage of the transfused granulocyte concentrates, and adverse effects had been recorded during each GTX cycle. GTX during an active infection were considered as “therapeutically” and GTX in patients who previously had survived life-threatening infections were considered as “prophylactically”. We evaluated overall survival and day- 30-mortality from infection according to several risk factors. Treatment-cycle- or product-related variables were modeled as time-dependent variables and analyzed with Cox regression with time-dependent covariate. Cumulative incidences of infection related deaths were estimated according to the methodology of Gray. Competing risk was death from other causes than infection. The cause specific hazard for death due to infection was estimated with Cox regression. Results: A total of 187 patients received 886 transfusions within 232 treatment cycles. The mean dose was 8.05 . 1010 neutrophil cells (SD =2.5) per transfusion. In 194 of 232 cycles (84 %) granulocytes were transfused therapeutically, in 37 cycles (16 %) prophylactically. Patient-related factors had impact on clinical outcome. State of the infection appeared to be the most important factor: Patients with septicemia had significantly lower treatment success than patients with localized infections with a significantly lower Overall survival (HR 2.4; CI: 1.68 - 3.52; p < .001) and a 4.8-fold higher cause specific hazard for infection-related death within 30 days after the first GTX (CI: 2.48 - 9.32; p < .001). Analysis of surrogate parameters for the severity of infections supported these findings (e.g. patients in ICU, patients requiring ventilation support, bacterial versus mycotic infections or a combination of both). Among transfusion-related factors, early administration of GTX was favorable for therapeutic success. Patients with prophylactic GTX had a significantly lower 30-dayinfection- mortality than patients with therapeutic GTX (HR 0.14; CI: 0.02 - 0.94; p = .044) and a slightly better overall survival (HR 0.71; CI: 0.38 - 1.27; p = .238). Patients who received ≥ 4.1010 granulocytes per transfusion had a significant lower 30-days-infection-related mortality (HR 0.76; CI: 0.63 - 0.92; p = .005). Transfusion reactions were seen in 60 out of 886 (7 %) transfusions. Our analysis revealed no difference in the frequency of side effects with respect to the amount of granulocytes per transfusion (HR 0.95; CI: 0.67 - 1.34; p = .756). Conclusions: Our data indicate that patients receiving GTX at an early stage of their infection seem to particularly benefit from this treatment. High dose GTX seem to be advantageous, In our cohort, GTX proved to be a safe approach without any severe side effects. Nevertheless, these retrospective data are limited and should be validated in further prospective controlled studies.",2020/12//,Nature Publishing Group,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2488397321?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2488397321; 634123583"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""risk assessment"", ""university hospital"", ""cohort analysis"", ""major clinical study"", ""assisted ventilation"", ""allotransplantation"", ""neutrophil"", ""septicemia"", ""overall survival"", ""female"", ""human"", ""side effect"", ""human tissue"", ""cancer survival"", ""drug megadose"", ""human cell"", ""blood transfusion reaction"", ""mycosis"", ""risk factor"", ""dependent variable"", ""granulocyte transfusion"", ""cancer staging"", ""controlled study"", ""clinical outcome"", ""cumulative incidence"", ""prospective study"", ""cancer chemotherapy"", ""cancer patient"", ""conference abstract"", ""mortality"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-01120-w"", ""issn"": ""14765365"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany , Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany, Inkari Thies, Kira, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 46th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-02-11"", ""Date revised - 2021-02-11"", ""Last updated - 2021-02-12""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Bone+Marrow+Transplantation&rft.atitle=Clinical+success+of+granulocyte+transfusions+in+adult+neutropenic+patients+after+chemotherapy+and%2For+allogeneic+transplantation-time+matters%21&rft.au=Inkari+Thies%2C+Kira&rft.aulast=Inkari+Thies&rft.aufirst=Kira&rft.date=2020-12-01&rft.volume=55&rft.issue=&rft.spage=271&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Bone+Marrow+Transplantation&rft.issn=14765365&rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Fs41409-020-01120-w"", ""date"": ""Dec 2020""}"

We investigated this hypothesis by reviewing our experience with Covid-19. Study Design/Methods: This is a retrospective review of COVID-19 pts evaluated for DAT between 03/2020 and 02/2021 at a tertiary-care center. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. We included pts evaluated for DAT within 30 days from a positive COVID-19 testing. Analyses were performed using SPSS; a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results were presented as median plus range, mean +/-standard deviation (SD), or percentages as indicated. Variables were compared using the independent two-sample Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and the Pearson's Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Results/Findings: 83 pts were included; 13(15.7%) were DAT-positive. The median age was 67 years (range 21-90); 51(61%) were females. Among the 13 DATpositive pts, 4(31%) tested positive for IgG and C3d, 5 (38%) tested positive for IgG only, and 4(31%) tested positive for C3d only.

The implementation of a protocol is key to ensure the patient's normothermia. Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent liver transplant in a tertiary hospital in a period between January 2016 and December 2018 was retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, patients with normothermia (core body temperature ≥ 36°C) and group 2, patients with hypothermia (core body temperature < 36°C). Mortality between both groups at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years is compared. Postoperative morbidity is also compared. Results: The incidence of IPH is 21.5%. Patients with normothermia present with statistical significance: a lower mortality at 1 year; a lower need for transfusion of platelets, plasma, fibrinogen consumption, or massive polytransfusion; and lower primary graft dysfunction, graft and surgical complications, rejection, hemodynamic complications, and metabolic and surgical reintervention.

AIMS: To investigate incidence of thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions requirement, associated diseases and relationship between thrombocytopenia and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven months hospital records between October 2013 and August 2014 of the PICU in a tertiary care teaching hospital was investigated retrospectively and 275 critically ill children formed the sample. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used. Probability value (p-value) of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results were confirmed using χ(2) test. RESULTS: Out of 275 patients {168 males (61.09%) and 107 females (38.91%)}, 89 patients had thrombocytopenia. Out of these 89 patients, 43 patients (48.31%) had severe, 24 patients (27.91%) had moderate and 22 patients (24.72%) had mild thrombocytopenia. The 43 patients having severe thrombocytopenia received platelet transfusion and out of these 43 patients 24 (55.81%) received more than one transfusion and 18 (41.86%) of the transfused patients expired. Among thrombocytopaenic patients, Sepsis (25.84%) was the most common diagnosis followed by Pneumonia (19.10%), Meningitis (13.48%), Diabetic Ketoacidosis (5.62%), Enteric fever (7.86%), Tubercular Meningitis (3.37%), Infantile Tremor Syndrome (2.25%), Congenital heart disease (5.62%), Burns(3.37%), Brain Haemorrhage (2.25%%), Hepatic abscess (1.12%), Chronic Renal Failure (3.37%), Malaria (2.25%) and Hepatitis (4.49%).

Aims: Investigate the relationship between the amount of frozen plasma infusion at shock stage and the prognosis of patients with major burn Methods: By using the whole closed-loop intelligent path management and infor-mation-evaluated retrieval system (self-developed),463 cases of patients with large area burn from January 2015 to January 2017 were found in Jiangxi province burn center, 86 cases were included in the study. Using the median amount of infusion of fresh frozen plasma as the packet threshold divided the patients into experimental group (frozen plasma transfusion <2000 ML and n = 41) and control group (frozen plasma transfusion>2000 ML and n = 45).Compare two groups' basic clinical data and clinical prognosis indicators. Use the logistic regression analysis simultaneously. Results: (1) the differences between the two groups in age, weight, TBSA, III degree burn area, urine volume, fluid volume, burn causes and inhalation injury number were not significant (P > 0.05); men were more than women in the two groups (P < 0.05); (2) comparison showed related prognostic index: two group burn ICU hospitalization time and hospitalization time were not significantly different (P > 0.05);mechanical ventilation time of experimental group were longer than the control group, the 30 day mortality rate was higher than that of the control group, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05); (3) the results of Logistic regression univariate analysis showed TBSA, III degree burn area, mechanical ventilation time, inhalation injury and the amount of frozen plasma transfusion during shock stage had effects on 30 days mortality (P < 0.05); (4) the results of multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that TBSA and the amount of frozen plasma transfusion during shock stage were independent influence factors (P < 0.05). Summary/Conclusions: TBSA and the amount of frozen plasma transfusion during shock stage were independent influence factors of 30 days mortality in patients with major burn.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered on 21 February 2020. As of 20 April, about 250 000 cases were registered, 1143 of which were in the province of Pescara. METHODS: We compared transfusion services provided by the blood centre of Pescara between 1 March and 20 April 2019 and between 1 March and 20 April 2020. We assessed the number and type of blood components donated, those transfused in the various hospital departments and those transfused to Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, we documented a decrease of 32% in the number of donations. The number of transfusions increased by 139% in the infectious diseases department (IDD), dedicated to Covid-19 patients, and by 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas it markedly decreased in the other departments. Of 299 patients with Covid-19, 60 were transfused (20.1%). Transfused patients in the ICU were significantly younger than those in IDD and had a lower number of lymphocytes, lower post-transfusion increment of haemoglobin levels and higher D-dimer and C reactive protein values. Mortality rate was 60.7% among transfused patients in the ICU and 39.0% among those in the IDD (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 epidemic had a profound impact on transfusion activities.

The aim of the study is to assess the incidence and predictors of GIH in patients undergoing mesenteric revascularization. METHODS: Single-center retrospective review of consecutive patients treated with open or endovascular mesenteric revascularization from 2009-2019. Patients with non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, intraoperative or perioperative death within 24 hours, or no post-operative follow-up were excluded. Primary endpoints were incidence and predictors of clinically significant GIH within 30- and 60 days postoperatively. Clinically significant GIH (CS-GIH) was defined if patients required RBC transfusion, hospital re-admission, escalation to intensive care, prolonged discontinuation of anticoagulation, or need for endoscopy/colonoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients presented with mesenteric ischemia and underwent OR/ER. 205 patients met inclusion criteria (139 female [68%], mean age of 69.9 years [range 18-92 years]). Presentation was chronic mesenteric ischemia in 128 patients (62%), acute-on-chronic in 45 (22%) and acute in 32 (16%). 93 (45%) underwent OR, 93 (45%) ER, and 19 (9%) hybrid. 50 patients (24%) presented with GIH, 44 (21%) within 30 days of OR/ER, at a median time of 6.5 days postoperatively. CS-GIH occurred in 37 patients (18%), which led to death in two patients (1%), prolongation of ICU course or transfer to ICU in 28 patients (14%), RBC transfusion in 21 (10%), diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopy/colonoscopy in 18 (9%), and hospital readmission in 14 patients (7%). Endoscopy/Colonoscopy was diagnostic in 9 patients (ulcer in five patients, angioectasia in two, and anastomotic bleeding or colonic necrosis in one each), therapeutic in four, and identifying one patient with diffuse bleeding requiring operative intervention. Factors associated with increased risk of CS-GIH were bowel resection during index hospitalization (OR 11.29, p < 0.001), acute presentation (OR 5.42, p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (OR 3.01, p = 0.004), first-time initiation of antiplatelet therapy (OR 2.61, p = 0.01), and treatment with stenting (2.31, p = 0.03 OR) (Table I). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing mesenteric revascularization are at high risk for postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which increases morbidity and hospitalization resources in nearly 20% of patients. Specific patient groups are at high risk for CS-GI hemorrhage. Post-operative care pathways should consider these risk factors to reduce CS-GIH after mesenteric revascularization to improve outcomes.",2024,United States,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2024.11.006,"{""pmid"": 39566833, ""electronic_issn"": ""1097-6809"", ""linking_issn"": ""0741-5214"", ""nlm_status"": ""Publisher"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""8407742"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""GI Bleed"", ""GI Hemorrhage"", ""Mesenteric Ischemia""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""aheadofprint"", ""publication_date"": ""2024 Nov 18"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2024-10-01"", ""accepted"": ""2024-11-11"", ""published"": ""2024-11-21"", ""revised"": ""2024-11-05"", ""electronic"": ""2024-11-18""}}"
20b2b403-176f-4349-816f-b783f8d3442c,Intermittent vs. continuous intravenous proton pump inhibitors for upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"['Kedzior, Sonya', 'Moore, Kerry', 'Bierman, Jesse']",Critical Care Medicine,49,1 SUPPL 1,285,"INTRODUCTION: In patients with high-risk bleeding ulcers, current guidelines recommend an intravenous proton pump inhibitor bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion. Metaanalysis evidence suggests that intermittent regimens are non-inferior to continuous; however, data comparing these two regimens are lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the real-world efficacy of these two dosing strategies in the empiric treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, pre-post cohort study was approved by the local institutional review board. Data were collected via chart review of patients admitted to Oregon Health & Science University between March 2016 and August 2019. A total of 139 patients were included after undergoing an endoscopy and receiving empiric treatment for upper gastrointestinal bleeding with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor. RESULTS: The primary outcome of incidence of re-bleeding rates 48 hours post-endoscopy was non-statistically significant between continuous vs intermittent treatment arms. Re-bleeding was defined as receipt of ≥1 unit blood product (38.6% vs. 25.5; p=0.10) or need for intervention (7.3% vs. 8.0; p=0.55). For patients who were recipients of ≥1 blood products, there was no statistical difference in either treatment arm for choice of transfusion product postendoscopy. Additionally, there were no differences in patients' hospital or intensive care unit length of stay, disposition or in-hospital mortality. The median cost of continuous vs intermittent dosing regimens did show a significant difference favoring intermittent therapy ([$452; IQR: 258, 883] vs. [$163; IQR: 99, 595], p=0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent dosing compared to continuous infusions did not show increased transfusion requirements or need for additional interventions. Intermittent regimens did however have a significantly lower cost of therapy. This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting intermittent dosing with the potential to decrease resource utilization and subsequent institutional costs.",2021/01//,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2515149552?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2515149552; 634767614"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""Oregon"", ""drug therapy"", ""medical record review"", ""cohort analysis"", ""meta analysis"", ""endoscopy"", ""proton pump inhibitor"", ""upper gastrointestinal bleeding"", ""controlled study"", ""comparative effectiveness"", ""conference abstract"", ""length of stay"", ""institutional review"", ""intensive care unit"", ""outcome assessment"", ""adult"", ""female"", ""human"", ""incidence"", ""hospital mortality"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000728220.90779.7e"", ""issn"": ""15300293"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, United States , Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States , University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, United States, Kedzior, Sonya, University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 50th Critical Care Congress"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-04-17"", ""Date revised - 2021-04-19"", ""Last updated - 2021-04-20""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.atitle=Intermittent+vs.+continuous+intravenous+proton+pump+inhibitors+for+upper+gastrointestinal+bleeding&rft.au=Kedzior%2C+Sonya&rft.aulast=Kedzior&rft.aufirst=Sonya&rft.date=2021-01-01&rft.volume=49&rft.issue=1+SUPPL+1&rft.spage=285&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Critical+Care+Medicine&rft.issn=15300293&rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2F01.ccm.0000728220.90779.7e"", ""date"": ""Jan 2021""}"

Interventions that reduce iatrogenic blood losses could reduce transfusions. The objectives of this pilot trial were to assess the feasibility (acceptability of the intervention and suitability of eligibility criteria) and potential effectiveness of pediatric size phlebotomy tubes in adult critically ill patients. Methods: We conducted a pilot, randomized controlled trial in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university‐affiliated, tertiary care referral hospital from November 2017 to September 2018. A total of 200 patients with hemoglobin of at least 7 g/dL and without bleeding were randomized to pediatric or adult size phlebotomy tubes. Stratification was according to baseline hemoglobin (7‐9.49 g/dL, 9.5‐11.99 g/dL, and 12 g/dL or greater). Acceptability was measured via the number of blood test recollections and the number of patients that discontinued the use of pediatric tubes. The suitability of patient eligibility criteria was determined by identifying baseline characteristics associated with RBC transfusions. Potential effectiveness was estimated from the time to RBC transfusion or to hemoglobin level below 7 g/dL. Results: The use of pediatric tubes was acceptable as patients experienced a low number of tests recollections (on average 1 every 57 days), and none of the participants discontinued their use. The baseline hemoglobin category was the only factor that appeared to be independently associated with RBC transfusions. A total of 6 patients (6%) in the pediatric tube group and 11 patients (11%) in the adult tube group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.9) received an RBC transfusion or reached hemoglobin below 7 g/dL. Almost all of these patients (16 of 17 participants) had baseline hemoglobin of 7‐9.49 g/dL. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that pediatric phlebotomy tubes are acceptable to patients and can therefore be used in adult ICU patients. A future study should focus on patients with hemoglobin levels below 9.5 g/dL, as these patients have a high risk of transfusions.

Original Research Background. In many situations, transfusions clearly improve longevity and/or quality of life (QOL). In terminal cancer patients the riskbenefit balance may sometimes be unclear. Research Objectives. We undertook this retrospective study to understand which non-laboratory factors may predict red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in the last 7 days of life. Methods. Between 10/1/2013 and 9/30/2015, 1248 in-patients with cancer died on medical oncology services at our institution. The primary endpoint was number of RBC units received within 7 days before death. Predictors included patient sex, age, race, religion, state/country of origin, cancer diagnosis, intensive care unit (ICU) death, length of stay (LOS), Do Not Resuscitate status, chaplaincy visits, and palliative medicine consultation. Associations between the predictors and number of RBC units received were evaluated using zero-hurdle negative binomial models to account for large numbers of patients who received zero RBC units. Results. Patients were mostly Caucasian (73%), Christian (58%), local residents (92% from NY/NJ/CT), and male (52%). Just under half (49%) were seen by palliative medicine within 7 days before death. Thirty-eight percent received 1-6 RBC units and 3% received 7 or more units (range 7-23) within 7 days before death. In the multivariable model, patients with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and genitourinary cancers were significantly more likely to receive RBC transfusion. ICU death predicted both receipt of RBC transfusion (OR=4.7) and higher number of units received (RR=1.5). Female sex was associated with receiving transfusion (OR=1.6). In unadjusted analysis, patients who had a palliative medicine consultation were less to likely to receive a transfusion (OR=0.72) and tended to receive fewer units (RR=0.72), but this was not significant in multivariable analysis. Conclusion. Sex, cancer type, and ICU death seem to influence end-of-life (EOL) transfusions whereas race, religion, and state/country of origin do not. Palliative consultation may reduce RBC transfusion at EOL for some patients but more research is needed to identify subgroups most impacted. Implications for research, policy or practice.

81cde1e9-e6ea-4489-8a79-83542f4a2e33,Intensive care department-transfusion profile over 3 years caring,"['Costa, C.M.']",Vox Sanguinis,115,SUPPL 1,324,"Background: The intensive care department (ICD) of Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca (HFF) with the capacity of 20 beds, is dedicated to the treatment of all critical patients, excluding patients with acute neurosurgical, cardiothoracic and vascular pathology due to the absence of this expertise in HFF. The majority of critical ill patients admitted in ICD are medical (65% of all admissions), however the ICD it's also prepare to surgical patients (28%). A wide range of diagnoses motivate the admission in ICD, however there seems to be a common factor: all of them will evolve with anaemia. And will need blood transfusion at any time over their stay, since this is the main form of anaemia treatment, despite the associated risks. This concerns us! For this motive we respect the recommended guidelines concerning blood components transfusion (restrictive approach) and we implemented some measures to minimize the iatrogenic anaemia that patients experience with daily phlebotomy to laboratory evaluation. The measures implemented were: use of smaller tubes (2ml and 4ml) for reduce the amount of blood collected daily for the lab; reassessed the analytical profiles needed daily. Aims: We intend to understand the trend of blood transfusion profile of our department over 3 years and correlate with gravity scores (SOFA, APACHE and SAPS II). We hope to improve our approach and performance with regard to blood transfusions. Methods: We counted, retrospectively, all blood transfusions over the last 3 years (2017, 2018, 2019), in our department, and we tried to understand the trend of the blood transfusion profile over this years comparing with gravity scores (SOFA, APACHE and SAPS II). The number of patients admitted and transfused in our department was taking in account as well. Results: 2584 patients were admitted to our department in 3 years of care (2017-822, 2018-905 and 2019-857). They were transfused with a total of 4785 of red blood cells units (2017-709; 2018-743 and 2019-796). A total of 539 patients received red blood cells transfusion (2017-149; 2018-179 and 2019-211). The results of gravity scores were: 2017 (APACHE II 33,7%; SOFA 5.6; SAPS II 43,4%); 2018 (APACHE II 35,5%; SOFA 6; SAPS II 38%); 2019 (APACHE II 38,3%; SOFA 6.7; SAPS II 41,9%) Summary/Conclusions: In the 3 years analysed period the number of blood transfusions has increased, as the number of transfusion patients. In 2018 we notice a peak in admitted number patients (905) and a decreased in 2019 (857). Over the analysed period the gravity scores suffered a discreet aggravation, especially the APACHE II and SOFA scores. Comparing the transfusion profile trend to the gravity scores the data suggests that the number of blood transfusions and the number of red blood transfused patients is correlated with the clinical ill state of the patient. Our practice of blood products transfusion was in agreement with the current guidelines recommended and we believe that implemented measures to minimize iatrogenic anaemia, will lead to decrease the number of patients who need transfusion. Our average hospital stay is 8.4 days. The use of smaller tubes and the reassessed of analytical profiles reduce the amount of blood collected in 61.32 ml/ week We will continue to follow the guidelines regarding blood transfusion and continue to try to implement measures that will allow us to transfuse our patients with maximum security.",2020/12//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2481393550?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2481393550; 633985835"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""surgical patient"", ""hospitalization"", ""major clinical study"", ""Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score"", ""care behavior"", ""human cell"", ""Simplified Acute Physiology Score"", ""anemia"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""security"", ""controlled study"", ""vascular disease"", ""phlebotomy"", ""gravity"", ""conference abstract"", ""intensive care unit"", ""adult"", ""female"", ""human"", ""practice guideline"", ""APACHE"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vox.13031"", ""issn"": ""14230410"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Intensive Care department, Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Lisboa, Portugal , Intensive Care department, Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Lisboa, Portugal, Costa, C.M., Intensive Care department, Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Lisboa, Portugal"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 36th International ISBT Congress"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-01-27"", ""Date revised - 2021-01-27"", ""Last updated - 2021-01-27""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.atitle=Intensive+care+department-transfusion+profile+over+3+years+caring&rft.au=Costa%2C+C.M.&rft.aulast=Costa&rft.aufirst=C.M.&rft.date=2020-12-01&rft.volume=115&rft.issue=SUPPL+1&rft.spage=324&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.issn=14230410&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fvox.13031"", ""date"": ""Dec 2020""}"
40ecaad7-237c-4912-8bc7-4f7eae7337c1,Assessment of blood components needs in a high complexity pediatric hospital,"['Pugliese, A.M.', 'Del Pozo, A.E.']",Vox Sanguinis,103,,239,"Background: The transfusion's management of blood components (BC) is critical to provide an adequate care to assisted patients in different areas of a high complexity hospital. It is essential to carefully plan the stock of these BC to achieve an effective and timely hospital transfusion requirements. Therefore it is essential to establish an adequate assessment of BC needs. Aims: Identify and evaluate the needs of BC in a National Reference Tertiary Pediatric Hospital by analyzing transfusion practices over a 5-year period. Methods: Different approaches to estimate blood needs have been published; we based this study on the PAHO/2010's recommendations. We performed a descriptive, observational, retrospective and transversal study. We considered the distribution of transfused population by age group and clinical conditions, based on the appropriate use of BC, following the national and hospital guidelines. Information was obtained from Hemotherapy Service computer records from January 2007 to December 2011. We have also considered the demographic profile of the assisted patients and the introduction of new technologies. Results: Table 1 shows the overall number of transfusion events (TE), the total number of patients transfused and the BC distribution from January 2007 to December 2011. The table shows a 10% increase of TE in the last 2 years relative to the media (28,297) of all TE occurred during the study period, and a 5% increase relative to the media (2970) of the total number of transfused patients in the study period. The distribution by type of component was stable during the study period, about 25-30% of the transfused units were CGR and about 60-65% were platelet concentrates, and the sum of both accounted for 85-90% of the total number of transfusions. The hematooncological patients (47% of all transfusions) had the higher requirements, 62% were inpatients and 38% were ambulatory; followed by patients from intensive care unit, bone marrow transplant (BMT), solid organ transplant and cardiovascular surgery (36% of TE in the considered period). Neonatology patients used between 2.9% and 4.4% of all transfusions, coinciding with the global trend for this age group. Table 1 Conclusions: The need of blood components could be estimated based on an appropriate and complete registered data of the population assisted at the institution, especially the transfused patients, considering their clinical condition and age group. The observed increase was due to the inclusion of unrelated BMT's, the ECMO technology, and the development of a National Pediatric Cardio-surgery Program. In our study the inclusion of previously excluded populations from complex health care led to the increase of patients requiring BC.

We sought to determine the rate of TACO caused by plasma transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted in two parts: 1) A retrospective analysis to determine the prevalence of TACO reactions caused by plasma at a tertiary care hospital from 2003 to 2010 was performed by analyzing the blood bank's electronic transfusion reaction records and 2) active surveillance of plasma recipients to determine if unreported TACO reactions had occurred over a 1-month period at the same hospital. RESULTS: Eighty-seven reactions to plasma had been reported to the blood bank from 2003 through 2010. Of these reactions 23% (20/87) were TACO. The historical prevalence rate of TACO was 1 in 1566 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1:2564-1:1014). During the prospective 1-month surveillance period, 84 patients received a total of 272 units of plasma, and four TACO reactions in separate patients (4.8%) were identified, none of which were reported to the blood bank. The prevalence rate of TACO in the prospective study was 1 in 68 (95% CI, 1:250-1:27). In total, most patients (14/24) were in the intensive care unit when they experienced TACO and on average they had received 4.0±2.3 units of plasma at an average rate of 647±315 mL/hr before the TACO reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Passive reporting of TACO grossly underestimates its actual prevalence.

In coronary bypass surgery, large volumes of homologous blood transfusion may be required due to excessive bleeding. The large number of use of homologous blood transfusion in open heart surgery and the awareness of its various harmful effects have prompted researchers to conduct research on the use of autologous blood. With autologous transfusion, blood diseases, incompatibility, immunosuppression and organ damage can be prevented and the patient can be extubated earlier in the postoperative period. METHODS: Between January 2020 and January 2016, a total of 176 patients, 56 in the treatment group (with autologous blood transfusion) and 120 in the control group, whose information could be reached from hospital records were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: No statistical difference was found between the mean intubation SO2 and PO2 values of the groups. On the contrary, considering the mean intubation times in the intensive care unit of both groups, the patients who underwent autologous blood transfusion were extubated at a statistically significant earlier time. CONCLUSION: Autologous blood transfusion is a safe method in selected patients as well. Thanks to this method, patients are protected from complications associated with homologous blood transfusion. It is believed that performing autologous blood transfusion in selected patients undergoing open-heart surgery can decrease the number of postoperative transfusions, frequency of transfusion-related complications (especially in the lungs), and mean intubation times.",2023,England,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17371,"{""pmid"": 37383208, ""electronic_issn"": ""2405-8440"", ""print_issn"": ""2405-8440"", ""linking_issn"": ""2405-8440"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101672560"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""Autologous"", ""Blood transfusion"", ""Coronary artery bypass"", ""Extubation""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2023 Jun"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2022-08-22"", ""accepted"": ""2023-06-14"", ""published"": ""2023-06-29"", ""revised"": ""2023-06-14"", ""electronic"": ""2023-06-15""}}"

Most data on this topic comes from trauma centres with high exposure to life-threatening haemorrhage. This study examines the effect of the introduction of an MTP in an Australian level 1 trauma centre. METHODS: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data was performed over a 14-year period. Three groups of trauma patients, who received more than 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), were compared: a pre-MTP group (2002-2006), an MTP-I group (2006-2010) and an MTP-II group (2010-2016) when the protocol was updated. Key outcomes were mortality, complications and number of blood products transfused. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were included: 54 pre-MTP patients were compared to 47 MTP-I and 67 MTP-II patients. In the MTP-II group, fewer units of PRBC and platelets were administered within the first 24 h: 17 versus 14 (P = 0.01) and 12 versus 8 (P < 0.001), respectively. Less infections were noted in the MTP-I group: 51.9% versus 31.9% (P = 0.04). No significant differences were found regarding mortality, ventilator days, intensive care unit and total hospital lengths of stay. CONCLUSION: Introduction of an MTP-II in our level 1 civilian trauma centre significantly reduced the amount of PRBC and platelets used during damage control resuscitation.

However, it is unclear if PLT transfusion is associated with reduced bleeding complications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults undergoing interventional radiology procedures between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Baseline characteristics, coagulation variables, transfusion requirements, and procedural details were evaluated. Propensity-matched analyses were used to assess relationships between PLT transfusions and the outcomes of interest, including a primary outcome of periprocedural red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during the procedure or within the first 24 hours after procedure. RESULTS: A total of 18,204 participants met inclusion criteria, and 2060 (11.3%) had a PLT count of not more than 100 × 109/L before their procedure. Of these, 203 patients (9.9) received preprocedural PLTs. There was no significant difference in RBC requirements between those receiving or not receiving preprocedural PLTs in propensity-matched analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-2.21; p = 0.085).

CONCLUSION: In patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing interventional radiology procedures, preprocedural PLT transfusion was not associated with reduced periprocedural RBC requirements. These findings suggest that prophylactic PLT transfusions are not warranted in nonbleeding patients with preprocedural PLT counts exceeding 50 × 109/L.

Data analysis included Mann-Whitney U test, Friedman test, Fisher's chi-square test, with statistical significance at p < 0.05. RESULTS: In our study, ICU and hospital stay duration showed no significant difference (p = 0.06) between groups. However, NLR group had longer mean mechanical ventilation (18 ± 40.1 h) than the LR group (12.8 ± 8.6 h). Both groups showed statistically significant increase in Fas-L level on days 1 and 7 (p < 0.05). The IL-10 levels rose 43% in the NLR group, while and decreased by 7% the LR group on day 1. On day 7, IL-10 increased by 75% in NLR and decreased by 40% in LR, with no significance (p > 0.05).

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults receiving intraoperative plasma transfusion at a single center from 2011 to 2015. Relationships between plasma transfusion volume, changes in coagulation test values, and clinical outcomes, including a primary outcome of early postoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, were assessed with multivariable regression analyses. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU)- and hospital-free days, intraoperative RBC transfusions, and estimated blood loss. RESULTS: A total of 3393 unique patients were included, with median (IQR) transfusion of 2 (2-4) units. In multivariable analyses, higher plasma volumes were associated with worse outcomes, with each 1 mL/kg increase associated with increased odds for postoperative (1.02 [1.01-1.03], p < 0.001) and intraoperative RBCs (1.17 [1.16-1.19], p < 0.001) and fewer ICU- and hospital-free days (mean difference [95% CI], –0.08 [−0.12 to −0.05], p < 0.001; and −0.09 [−0.13 to −0.06], p < 0.001, respectively). Greater decreases in international normalized ratio (INR) following plasma transfusion were associated with decreased odds of postoperative RBCs (0.35 [0.25-0.47], p < 0.001), decreased mortality (0.50 [0.31-0.83], p = 0.007), and increased mean ICU- (1.31 [0.41-2.21], p = 0.004) and hospital-free days (1.15 [0.19-2.10], p = 0.018).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of transfusion guidelines in reducing the number of transfusions given to infants with BW <1250 gm. METHODS: This cohort study was conducted at the regional teaching medical center with level III obstetric and neonatal services. Preterm infants with BW <1250 gm and gestational age <32 weeks were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during a period of 6 months before and after implementation of transfusion guidelines. The final sample size constituted 39 infants before guidelines (BG) and 41 infants after guidelines (AG).

STUDY DESIGN: Case-crossover study of neonatal intensive care infants born at ≤ 32 weeks' gestation who were admitted to 5 central Ohio intensive care units from January 2012-July 2016 and developed NEC Bell Stage ≥2. Each patient served as their own control, with exposure during the 48-hour period just prior to NEC onset (hazard period) being compared to a preceding 48-hour control period, thus eliminating confounding by patient factors fixed between both intervals. NEC onset was determined by chart review as the earliest occurrence of one of the following within 24 hours of confirmatory x-ray: (1) antibiotic initiation, (2) enteral feeding cessation, (3) physician first notified of abdominal concerns, or (4) abdominal x-ray ordered. Conditional logistic regression compared exposures to feed volume increase, fortification, and PRBC transfusion during the 48-hour period prior to NEC onset to those during a preceding 48-hour control period. Analyses were stratified by gestational age and anemia (defined: hemoglobin ≤ 9.3 g/dL within 7 days of NEC onset). RESULTS: We included 63 infants with confirmed NEC.

Recently, custom computer-generated implants (CCGIs) have gained popularity with surgeons because of potential advantages, which include preoperatively planned contour, obviated donor-site morbidity, and operative time savings. A remaining concern is the cost of CCGI production. The purpose of the present study was to objectively compare the operative time and relative cost of cranioplasties performed with autologous versus CCGI techniques at our center. METHODS: A review of all autologous and CCGI cranioplasties performed at our institution over the last 7 years was performed. The following operative variables and associated costs were tabulated: length of operating room, length of ward/intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hardware/implants utilized, and need for transfusion. RESULTS: Total average cost did not differ statistically between the autologous group (n = 15; $25,797.43) and the CCGI cohort (n = 12; $28,560.58). Operative time (P = 0.004), need for ICU admission (P < 0.001), and number of complications (P = 0.008) were all statistically significantly less in the CCGI group. The length of hospital stay and number of cases needing transfusion were fewer in the CCGI group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated no significant increase in overall treatment cost associated with the use of the CCGI cranioplasty technique. In addition, the latter was associated with a statistically significant decrease in operative time and need for ICU admission when compared with those patients who underwent autologous bone cranioplasty.

However, the effects on blood flow have been found to be conflicting. Methods: We studied ICU patients with stable hemodynamic status (mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg for at least 6 hours) and without active bleeding, who received a RBCT. Skin blood flow (SBF) was determined (Periflux System 5000, Perimed, index finger; perfusion unit, PU) together with MAP, heart rate (HR), hemoglobin (Hb), lactate levels and ScvO2 before and after RBCT. SBF was measured before RBCT (T0) and after (T1) for each 3 min. According to previous data indicating the lowest SBF value found in noninfected ICU patients was 151 PU, all patients were analyzed according to the baseline SBF (i.e. <151 PU-low SBF vs. ≥151 PU-high SBF). The relative change of SBF (ΔSBF) was calculated after RBCT and the responders were defined by the function of >10%. Results: 63 ICU patients were studied. RBCT was associated with increases in MAP and ScvO2 but no change in SBF. At baseline, ScvO2 was lower in the responders than in the non-responders (p=0.04) and lower in patients with low SBF than in the high SBF (p=0.04). There was no difference in Hb, MAP, and lactate, between the patients with low and high SBF. After RBCT, MAP rose in the responders (p<0.01) and in the non-responders (p=0.03), SBF (p<0.01) rose in patients with low SBF, and SBF (p=0.02) decreased in patients with high SBF. There was a negative correlation between baseline ScvO2 (r=-0.363, p<0.01) or baseline SBF (r=-0.560, p<0.01) and the relative increase in SBF after RBCT.

Hyperbilirubinaemia necessitating exchange transfusion in an infant of a mother with SCD, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. Case presentation: An infant was delivered at 33 weeks and 5 days of gestation due to a maternal sickle cell crisis. The infant had an unconjugated bilirubin level of 153 μmol/L on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit at 30 min of age. Phototherapy was immediately commenced, intravenous immunoglobulin administered and then a double-volume exchange transfusion was performed.

Risks of preeclampsia and preterm delivery were previously observed, but data on gestational diabetes, maternal and neonatal ICU admissions were sparse. Most data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes have been derived from the transplantation registry and single-center retrospective studies. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Linked Birth File. Exposure was defined as a history of heart, lung, liver, or kidney transplantation using maternal ICD-9 codes. Primary outcomes included risks of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, maternal and neonatal ICU admissions. Secondary outcomes included blood transfusion, hysterectomy, unplanned cesarean delivery, low Apgar score, neonatal intubation, stillbirth, and neonatal death. RESULTS: This study included 3,186,249 patients in the control group and 263 patients in the exposure group. The most commonly transplanted organs are kidneys, followed by liver, heart, and lungs. When compared to controls, patients with heart, liver, or kidney transplant had significantly increased risk of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, and maternal and neonatal ICU admissions. Risks of hysterectomy, unplanned cesarean delivery, neonatal intubation, and stillbirth in the exposure group were similar to the control group. Patients with kidney transplantation presented with the highest rates of the aforementioned complications, with further increased risks of maternal blood transfusion, low Apgar score, and neonatal death.

This study was performed to characterize anemia, transfusion, and phlebotomy practices in patients with prolonged ICU LOS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients admitted to a medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary care university hospital over three years; patients included had a continuous LOS in the ICU of 30 days or longer. Information on transfusion, phlebotomy, and outcomes were collected daily from days 22 to 112 of the ICU stay. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were enrolled. The mean age, admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and median ICU LOS were 62.3 +/- 16.3 years, 23 +/- 8, and 49 days (interquartile range 36-70 days), respectively. Mean hemoglobin remained stable at 9.4 +/- 1.4 g/dl from day 7 onward. Mean daily phlebotomy volume was 13.3 +/- 7.3 ml, and 62% of patients received a mean of 3.4 +/- 5.3 units of packed red blood cells at a mean hemoglobin trigger of 7.7 +/- 0.9 g/dl after day 21. Transfused patients had significantly greater acuity of illness, phlebotomy volumes, ICU LOS and mortality, and had a lower hemoglobin than did those who were not transfused. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following as independently associated with the likelihood of requiring transfusion in nonbleeding patients: baseline hemoglobin, daily phlebotomy volume, ICU LOS, and erythropoietin therapy (used almost exclusively in dialysis dependent renal failure in this cohort of patients). Small increases in average phlebotomy (3.5 ml/day, 95% confidence interval 2.4-6.8 ml/day) were associated with a doubling in the odds of being transfused after day 21. CONCLUSION: Anemia, phlebotomy, and transfusions, despite low hemoglobin triggers, are common in ICU patients long after admission.

Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (ASCP) and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) have proven to be reliable methods of brain protection during aortic surgery. These techniques are usually accompanied by systemic circulatory arrest with moderate hypothermia (24-28°C) or deep hypothermia (18-24°C). However, hypothermia can lead to various problems. The present study therefore reports results for thoracic aorta replacement using ASCP with mild hypothermic systemic arrest (28-32°C). Design. Between 1995 and 2003, 68 consecutive patients underwent repair of the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch. Mild hypothermic ASCP was utilized in 31 cases, moderate hypothermic ASCP in 20, and deep hypothermic RCP in 17. Various parameters were compared between the mild hypothermic ASCP, moderate hypothermic ASCP, and RCP. Results. Hospital mortality was 10.3%, with no significant differences observed between any groups. Permanent neurological dysfunction was 8.8%, and no significant differences were observed between any groups. Mild hypothermic ASCP displayed significantly decreased transfusion volume, intubation time, and ICU stay. Conclusions. Use of ASCP with mild hypothermic systemic circulatory arrest during aortic surgery resulted in acceptable hospital mortality and neurological outcomes. ASCP with mild hypothermic arrest allows decreased transfusion volume and reduced duration of intubation and ICU stay. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",2005,"Informa Healthcare, 69-77 Paul Street, EC2A 4LQ",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/701658142?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""701658142; 40662742"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Cerebral perfusion"", ""Circulatory arrest"", ""Hypothermia"", ""Thoracic aortic surgery"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""9:Surgery"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""major clinical study"", ""neurologic disease -- complication"", ""thoracic aorta"", ""brain perfusion"", ""profound induced hypothermia"", ""brain protection"", ""intensive care unit"", ""heart arrest"", ""priority journal"", ""female"", ""human"", ""retrograde cerebral perfusion"", ""blood transfusion"", ""aged"", ""intubation"", ""aorta arch"", ""article"", ""aorta surgery"", ""induced hypothermia"", ""brain blood flow"", ""mortality"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""antegrade selective cerebral perfusion"", ""ascending aorta""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14017430410004614"", ""issn"": ""14017431"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kishiwada City Hospital, 1001 Gakuhara-Cho, Kishinada City, Osaka 596-8501, Japan toshio_kaneda@hotmail.com, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama City, Osaka, Japan , Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kishiwada City Hospital, 1001 Gakuhara-Cho, Kishinada City, Osaka 596-8501, Japan, Kaneda, T., Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Kishiwada City Hospital, 1001 Gakuhara-Cho, Kishinada City, Osaka 596-8501, Japan"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2005-05-27"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-17"", ""Number of references - 7"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-01"", ""CODEN - SCJOF""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Scandinavian+Cardiovascular+Journal&rft.atitle=Antegrade+selective+cerebral+perfusion+with+mild+hypothermic+systemic+circulatory+arrest+during+thoracic+aortic+surgery&rft.au=Kaneda%2C+Toshio&rft.aulast=Kaneda&rft.aufirst=Toshio&rft.date=2005-01-01&rft.volume=39&rft.issue=1-2&rft.spage=87&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Scandinavian+Cardiovascular+Journal&rft.issn=14017431&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F14017430410004614"", ""date"": ""2005""}"

The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors related to persistent hypotension requiring cardiotonic agent use among monochorionic twin pregnancies without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 316 monochorionic twin pregnancies without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (632 babies). All cases were treated in the neonatal intensive care unit. Hypotension was defined as mean arterial blood pressure below the norm for gestational age. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction was defined as a value <60%. Dopamine, dobutamine and phosphodiesterase III inhibitor were used as cardiotonic agents for hypotension persisting even after adequate infusion. RESULTS: Among the 632 cases, 33 (5.2%) needed cardiotonic agents for persistent hypotension. The frequency of persistent hypotension with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher among larger twins (4.4%) than among smaller twins (0.6%, p = 0.0038). In larger twins, multivariate analysis showed that Z-score for cardiothoracic area ratio (odds ratio, 2.31; p < 0.001), tricuspid regurgitation (odds ratio, 6.34; p = 0.015) and gestational age at delivery (odds ratio, 0.66; p < 0.001) correlated with persistent hypotension. In smaller twins, univariate analysis showed gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Z-score for birth weight and Z-score for cardiothoracic area ratio of the larger twin were related to persistent hypotension. Concentration of brain natriuretic peptide in the umbilical vein in larger and smaller twins were significantly correlated (coefficient of correlation = 0.792, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In monochorionic twin pregnancies, attention needs to be given to cardiac size along with amniotic fluid and fetal growth.

1fa77e73-b785-40b1-aff2-5e8159810ef7,Direct to or resuscitation of abdominal trauma: An NTDB propensity matched outcomes study,"['Habarth-Morales, Theodore E.', 'Rios-Diaz, Arturo J.', 'Gadomski, Stephen P.', 'Stanley, Tiffani', 'Donnelly, Julie P.', 'Koenig, George J.', 'Cohen, Murray J.', 'Marks, Joshua A.']",Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,92,5,792-799,"BACKGROUND Direct to operating room resuscitation (DOR) is used by some trauma centers for severely injured trauma patients as an approach to minimize time to hemorrhage control. It is unknown whether this strategy results in favorable outcomes. We hypothesized that utilization of an emergency department operating room (EDOR) for resuscitation of patients with abdominal trauma at an urban Level I trauma center would be associated with decreased time to laparotomy and improved outcomes. METHODS We included patients 15 years or older with abdominal trauma who underwent emergent laparotomy within 120 minutes of arrival both at our institution and within a National Trauma Data Bank sample between 2007 to 2019 and 2013 to 2016, respectively. Our institutional sample was matched 1:1 to an American College of Surgeons National Trauma Databank sample using propensity score matching based on age, sex, mechanism of injury, and abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale score. The primary outcome was time to laparotomy incision. Secondary outcomes included blood transfusion requirement, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, hospital LOS, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Two hundred forty patients were included (120 institutional, 120 national). Both samples were well balanced, and 83.3% sustained penetrating trauma. There were 84.2% young adults between the ages of 15 and 47, 91.7% were male, 47.5% Black/African American, with a median Injury Severity Score of 14 (interquartile range [IQR], 8-29), Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (IQR, 13-15), 71.7% had an systolic blood pressure of >90 mm Hg, and had a shock index of 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.1) which did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). Treatment in the EDOR was associated with decreased time to incision (25.5 minutes vs. 40 minutes; p ≤ 0.001), ICU LOS (1 vs. 3.1 days; p < 0.001), transfusion requirement within 24 hours (3 units vs. 5.8 units packed red blood cells; p = 0.025), hospital LOS (5 days vs. 8.5 days, p = 0.014), and ventilator days (1 day vs. 2 days; p ≤ 0.001). There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (22.5% vs. 15.0%; p = 0.14) or outcome-free days (4.9 days vs. 4.5 days, p = 0.55). CONCLUSION The use of an EDOR is associated with decreased time to hemorrhage control as evidenced by the decreased time to incision, blood transfusion requirement, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, and ventilator days. These findings support DOR for patients sustaining operative abdominal trauma.

The goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between the amount of blood transfused before transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and the clinical outcome later in the disease course. Methods: Patients with pelvic fractures who underwent TAE for hemostasis from January 2018 to December 2019 were studied. The characteristics of patients who received blood transfusions of >2 U (1000 mL) and ≤2 U before TAE were compared. The mortality rate, blood transfusion-related complications, and length of stay were compared between these two groups. Results: Among the 75 studied patients, 39 (52.0%) received blood transfusions of ≤2 U before TAE, and the other 36 (48.0%) patients received blood transfusions of >2 U before TAE. The incidence rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and coagulopathy were significantly higher in the >2 U group (97.2% vs 81.1%, P =.027; 50.0% vs 27.0%, P =.045; and 44.4% vs 5.4%, P <.01, respectively). After nonsurvivors were excluded, the >2 U group had a significantly higher proportion (43.8% vs 14.7%, P <.001) of prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (7 days or more) and a longer hospital length of stay (33.8 ± 15.1 vs 21.9 ± 94.0, P <.01) than the ≤2 U group.

92785ec7-ba39-47c6-a40b-e4bac34bdf55,Clinical outcomes for patients on antiplatelet and anticoagulants in thoracoabdominal trauma,"['Sharp, Victoria', 'Bazzi, Rola', 'Hecht, Jason P.']",Surgery Open Science,16,,44-48,"Introduction: Trauma outcomes can be greatly affected by antiplatelet and anticoagulant (AP/AC) use. The goal of this study was to compare outcomes in trauma patients on AP/AC undergoing emergent surgery for thoracoabdominal trauma at 35 level 1 and 2 trauma centers from 2014 to 2021. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 2460 adult patients with a chest, abdomen, or pelvis abbreviated injury score (AIS) of 2 or more who underwent surgery within 24 h of admission. These patients were segregated into four main cohorts based on antiplatelet/anticoagulation use: those not on AP/AC, those taking direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), those taking clopidogrel, and those taking warfarin. Patients were excluded if they had surgery >24 h after presentation, were dead on arrival, or had any other body system AIS score of 3 or higher. Results: The mean injury severity score (ISS) in all four groups ranged from 16.3 to 18.6 (p = 0.834) with a mean time to operating room from 208 to 478 min (p < 0.001). Laparotomy was performed in 60 to 71 % (p > 0.01) of patients, regardless of AP/AC status, and thoracic procedures were performed in 3.1 to 9.3 % (p = 0.42) of patients. In-hospital mortality and hospice rates were highest in the clopidogrel group at 21.9 %, followed by warfarin at 13 %, DOACs at 15 %, and no AP/AC at 7.63 % (p = 0.008). Serious complications occurred in 61 % of patients on warfarin, 50 % of those on DOACs, and 44 % of those on clopidogrel. All of these groups demonstrated significantly higher complication rates than patients in the no AP/AC control group at 25 % (p < 0.001). Total transfusion of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma did not differ significantly between the groups; however, 24-h platelet transfusion did. Patients on clopidogrel received 14 packs of platelets, while those on warfarin and DOACs received 8 and 13 packs respectively (p = 0.011). Patients on warfarin had the longest hospital length of stay (LOS) at 13 days and ICU LOS at 9 days, compared to those on DOACs (8 and 4), those on clopidogrel (7 and 3), and those not taking AC/AP (7 and 4) (hospital LOS p = 0.03, ICU LOS p = 0.019). Those on AC/AP were also noted to be significantly older than those on neither, with those taking these medications averaging out to be approximately 69 years old and those not on these medications averaging 37 years old (p < 0.001). Conclusion: There was significantly higher mortality in patients on clopidogrel and increased length of stay and risk of serious complications in patients taking DOACs and warfarin. In patients on AP/AC there was also a significantly longer time to surgery than in those not taking either. Given these associations trauma surgeons should consider intervening sooner on patients taking AP/AC on admission, as the delay to intervention may contribute to the risks for trauma patients and result in worse outcomes as well as higher rates of mortality.",2023/12//,Elsevier B.V.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2869301999?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2869301999; 2027185191"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Anticoagulant"", ""Antiplatelet"", ""Outcomes"", ""Thoracoabdominal trauma"", ""Torso trauma"", ""clopidogrel"", ""113665-84-2"", ""120202-66-6"", ""90055-48-4"", ""94188-84-8"", ""120202-65-5"", ""120202-67-7"", ""894353-16-3"", ""744256-69-7"", ""warfarin"", ""129-06-6"", ""2610-86-8"", ""3324-63-8"", ""5543-58-8"", ""81-81-2"", ""Embase"", ""17:Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""48:Gastroenterology"", ""clopidogrel -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""major clinical study"", ""dead on arrival"", ""emergency surgery"", ""thorax surgery"", ""intensive care unit"", ""outcome assessment"", ""thorax injury -- surgery"", ""female"", ""operating room"", ""anticoagulant agent -- oral drug administration"", ""anticoagulant agent -- drug comparison -- clopidogrel"", ""clopidogrel -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- pediatric patient"", ""anticoagulant agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""adult"", ""male"", ""retrospective study"", ""warfarin -- special situation for pharmacovigilance"", ""in-hospital mortality"", ""clopidogrel -- drug comparison -- warfarin"", ""hospital admission"", ""comparative study"", ""abdominal injury -- surgery"", ""disease assessment"", ""cohort analysis"", ""United States"", ""hospital discharge"", ""Article"", ""anticoagulant agent -- drug comparison"", ""laparotomy"", ""thoracoabdominal trauma -- surgery"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""anticoagulant agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- pediatric patient"", ""disease severity"", ""human"", ""anticoagulant therapy"", ""blood transfusion"", ""hospitalization"", ""warfarin -- drug comparison -- clopidogrel"", ""injury scale"", ""warfarin -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- pediatric patient"", ""antithrombocytic agent -- special situation for pharmacovigilance -- pediatric patient"", ""clopidogrel -- drug comparison"", ""mortality rate"", ""warfarin -- drug comparison"", ""clopidogrel -- drug comparison -- anticoagulant agent"", ""length of stay"", ""postoperative complication -- complication"", ""pelvis abbreviated injury score"", ""premedication""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sopen.2023.09.019"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Trinity Health Ann Arbor, Department of Surgery, 5301 McAuley Dr Suite 2402, Ypsilanti, MI, 48197, United States Victoria_sharp@ihacares.com, Trinity Health Ann Arbor, Department of Pharmacy, 5301 E.

Despite silent cerebral ischemia (SCI) and infarction are well-recognized cause of neurologic injury in patients with sickle cell anemia data from thalassemia that have only recently started to reveal. Aims: We conducted 10-year research in understanding the prevalence, the potential underlying risk factors and required optimal prevention and treatment of SCI in thalassemia. Methods: Three cross-sectional and one historical cohort studies have been performed on 135 neurologically intact thalassemia patients (49 NTDT and 86 TDT) from 2008 to 2018 (table1). Diffusion-weighted imaging brain MRI (1.5 tesla) was used. Results: The silent brain lesions in asymptomatic patients with NTDT and TDT have been demonstrated changes in the white matter suggestive of ischemia and small infarctions (figure1). Overall, based on the results of 3 cross-sectional studies, white matter lesions (WML) were found in 30 of 135 patients (22.2%) including 11 of 49 NTDT (22.4%) and 19 of 86 TDT (22%). Splenectomy, age > 30 years old, no history of Hydroxyurea, iron overload, platelet counts > 500000/mm3 and hemoglobin level < 9 g/dl were risk factors for SCI. In one historical cohort study, brain MRI in 35 NTDT and TDT patients was evaluated over 3 years. The frequency of WMLs was increased from 10 patients (28.6%) in the first MRI to 13 patients (37.1%) in the second MRI after 3 years. In a different study we also described 5 TDT and 2 NTDT cases who presented with overt cerebrovascular accident (CVA), five ischemic, two hemorrhage and two of them died. ∗Non-Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia, ∗ ∗Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia∗ ∗ ∗ This study included 30 NTDT patients of Karimi et al (2010) article and 65 new patients. ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ Infarction was defined abnormally high signal intensity on the T2 and FLAIR weighted images.

Summary/Conclusion: The long-term sequelae of SCI findings and monitor asymptomatic brain damage by regular brain MRI once every 2-3 years is crucial although experience from patients with sickle cell anemia confirms their association with subsequent overt stroke and neurocognitive deficits. According to high risk factors for SCI, Aspirin, Hydroxyurea, keep the Hb levels ≥9 g/dL, regular iron chelation regimen and try to preserve the spleen are the management strategies to prevent new or progressive silent brain lesions.

It's an independent risk factor for hospitalization, readmission, prolonged length of stay, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. To mitigate these risks, a multidisciplinary program was implemented to manage anemia pre-operatively as a patient blood management (PBM) initiative. Study Design/Method: From 2/2016-9/2017, patients (N=240) presenting for elective cardiac surgery were screened for anemia (Hgb<12g/dL). 58(24%) patients were found to be anemic and referred for anemia workup to determine cause and appropriate management. 33(57%) patients were found to have iron deficiency anemia and 25(43%) were deemed anemic due to other reasons. A historical cohort of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with Hgb<12g/dL from 3/2015-7/2015 (N=92) served as control group. Comparisons were controlled for age, sex, and procedures. Primary outcome was perioperatively blood transfusion. Secondary outcomes were date-of-surgery Hgb, red blood cell (RBC) transfused/patient, and cost analysis. Results/Finding: The two most common treatments were intravenous iron +/-folate (N=27; 47%) and folate +/-B12 (N=17; 29%) 7(12%) patients received no treatment and 2 were diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. None of the patients receiving IV Iron (Fereheme) had any complications or reactions. Study patients had significantly lower rates of RBC transfusion compared to the historical cohort (24% vs 60%, p<0.0001) and had higher day-of-surgery Hgb (11.01 vs. 10.16 g/dL, p<0.001) (Table). Study patients also had a decrease in blood utilization from 2.07 to 0.4 RBC units/patient (p<0.0001). Analysis of RBC acquisition cost and transfusion cost also showed significant saving ($367 and $1,837/patient, respectively). Conclusion: Our pilot anemia program, which only started in one group of surgical patients, showed significant reduction in RBC transfusion rates and costs.

This multicenter, quality improvement study aimed to sustainably decrease the rate of RBC transfusions in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). METHODS: This 16-month prospective study included 5 PICUs. We implemented a standardized project plan including education, bedside tools, real-time reminders, and email feedback. We collected data from consecutive transfusions during pre-implementation (Phase I), postimplementation (Phase II), and post-stabilization phases (Phase III). RESULTS: Of the 2,064 RBC transfusions, we excluded 35% (N = 729) from analysis in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Transfusion/1,000 admissions improved throughout the study periods from a baseline 209.6 -199.8 in Phase II and 195.8 in Phase III (P value < 0.05). There were fewer transfusions outside of the hemoglobin threshold guideline, decreasing from 81% of transfusions outside of guidelines in Phase I to 74% in Phases II and III, P < 0.05. Study phase, site, co-management status, service of requesting provider, admit reason, previous transfusion status, and age were associated with transfusion above guideline threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Multicenter collaboration can successfully deploy a standardized plan that adheres to implementation science principles to sustainably decrease the rate of RBC transfusion outside of guideline thresholds. However, we did not decrease the total number of transfusions in our study. The complexity of multiple specialties co-managing patients is common in the contemporary PICU.

We sought to characterize how pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with maternal morbidity in the setting of placenta previa. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of women with placenta previa delivered by cesarean section, the primary exposure, BMI, was categorized as normal (18.5-25), overweight (25-30), or obese (>30). Women with BMI <18.5 or placenta accreta were excluded. The primary outcome, a composite including death, hysterectomy, blood transfusion, endometritis, surgical injury, arterial ligation, ileus, and ICU admission, among others, was compared by BMI. RESULTS: 555 women were included. 306 (55%) were normal weight, 157 (28%) were overweight, and 92 (17%) were obese/morbidly obese. The primary outcome occurred in 21% of normal weight, 28% of overweight, and 30% of obese women (p=0.03). Increasing BMI was associated with blood transfusion (p=0.03), endometritis (p=0.04), uterine artery ligation (p=0.02), surgical injury (p=0.003), anesthetic complications (p=0.02), and increased length of hospitalization (p=0.02). In multivariable analysis adjusting for BMI, race, marital status, payor, diabetes, and number of cesarean sections, overweight women were more likely to require uterine artery ligation (adjusted OR 8.54, 95% CI 2.30-31.81).

This survey aims to describe which physiologic markers are measured and available in British and Canadian paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Patients and methods: A pre-piloted self-administered questionnaire was electronically sent out thrice, using Survey Monkey, from November 2017 to February 2018, to the director of 16 Canadian and 27 British PICUs. The list of 17 physiologic markers included in the survey was developed by a group of 42 experts who participated in the 'Transfusion and anemia expertise initiative' (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2018 Sept + 19(9S Suppl 1)). Respondents were asked to indicate if the markers listed were available in their PICU. Results: Replies were received from 12 Canadian and 25 British PICUs (37 43 = 86%) + three declined the invitation because only premature infants and newborns were admitted into their unit. Results are presented in Table 1. Conclusion: Many physiologic measurements advocated by paediatric intensivists to support RBC transfusion decision are not routinely available at the bedside.

On arrival, the patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound revealing a 17.2 × 12.9 × 14.5 cm right sided renal mass. A CTA triple phase showed free peritoneal air and fluid in the anterior abdomen/pelvis concerning for bladder perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Prior to surgery, the patient declared that he was a Jehovah's Witness and refused any form of blood replacement regardless of the surgical outcome (although approved of albumin and cell saver if indicated). His hemoglobin (hgb) was 7.6 prior to surgery. During the nephrectomy, one of the multiple accessory veins in the renal hilum began to bleed excessively, requiring conversion to an open procedure. The patient became hypotensive, refractory to fluid resuscitation and subsequently required levophed, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine. Post operatively, he remained intubated and was transferred to the ICU for hemorrhagic shock. At this time his hgb had decreased to 5.8.

Methods: All data of the patients who underwent MIPN from 2006 to 2008 were entered into a prospectively maintained, computerized database. Results: A total of 93 MIPN procedures were performed on 32 patients. All patients had severe acute pancreatitis. The median number of MIPN procedures per patient was 3. Only 6 patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission after MIPN. There were 15 complications, which included bleeding requiring transfusion (n = 3), bowel fistulae (n = 7), thromboembolic events (n = 2) and acute myocardial infarction (n = 3).

Three of these patients required intervention. Conclusion: This case series demonstrates that MIPN can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality and with good end results. The ICU dependency after the procedure is minimal. As seen in this series, multiple MIPNs may be needed to eradicate the necrosis satisfactorily. Copyright © 2011 S.

Objectives: The objective of this systematic review was to identify evidence based intraoperative transfusion and coagulation management strategies that improve immediate and short-term outcomes after LT. Methods: PRISMA-guidelines and GRADE-approach were followed. Three subquestions were formulated. (Q); Q1: transfusion management; Q2: antifibrinolytic therapy; and Q3: coagulation monitoring. Results: Sixteen studies were included for Q1, six for Q2, and 10 for Q3. Q1: PRBC and platelet transfusions were associated with higher mortality. The use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fibrinogen concentrate (FC) were not associated with reductions in intraoperative transfusion or increased thrombotic events. The use of cell salvage was not associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence or mortality. Cell salvage and transfusion education significantly decreased blood product transfusions. Q2: Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA) were not associated with decreased blood product transfusion, improvements in patient or graft survival, or increases in thrombotic events. Q3: Viscoelastic testing (VET) was associated with decreased allogeneic blood product transfusion compared to conventional coagulation tests (CCT) and is likely to be cost-effective. Coagulation management guided by VET may be associated with increases in FC and PCC use. Conclusion: Q1: A specific blood product transfusion practice is not recommended (QOE; low | Recommendation; weak). Cell salvage and educational interventions are recommended (QOE: low | Grade of Recommendation: moderate). Q2: The routine use of antifibrinolytics is not recommended (QOE; low | Recommendation; weak).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the transfusion requirement in both cadaveric (CDLT, n = 22) and living donor (LDLT, n = 24) pediatric LT performed in our institution. Balanced general anesthesia was used for all patients. Transfusion requirements were met to maintain a hemoglobin concentration of 8-10 g/dL, platelet level >50 x 10(3)/mL, prothrombin time <20 s and hemodynamic course with observing heart rate, arterial and central venous blood pressures and hourly urine output. Blood loss was replaced by using whole blood. Both groups' perioperative total blood and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) volumes transfused, fluid requirements and hemodynamic courses, standard coagulation profile and metabolic variables determined in time periods of operations, patients' preoperative characteristics, operative features and postoperative events were compared. The mean transfusion requirements were 37.1 +/- 33.4 and 74.8 +/- 90.8 mL/kg of whole blood (p = 0.059) and 34.5 +/- 24.9 and 51.5 +/- 59.7 mL/kg of FFP for CDLT and LDLT, respectively (p = 0.519). The mean ages and mean body weights of the CDLT patients were higher than LDLT patients (9.7 +/- 5.3 vs. 6.6 +/- 4.4 yr, p = 0.015 and 32.4 +/- 17.7 vs. 21.0 +/- 14.8 kg, p = 0.032, respectively) while the mean operation time (493 +/- 135 vs. 323 +/- 93 min, p = 0.0001) and PELD score (13.1 +/- 11.2 vs. 20.1 +/- 11.8, p = 0.036) were higher for LDLT. In the entire population, multiple regression analysis showed that age, body weight and operation time have a significant combined effect on blood consumption (r2= 0.29, p = 0.003) meanwhile operation time was found to be an effective single variable (p = 0.002). None of the single or combined variables was found to have a significant effect on FFP consumption (r2= 0.17, p = 0.63) and crystalloid use (r2= 0.19, p = 0.11). Hemodynamic courses of both groups were similar. The incidences of metabolic acidosis and hypothermia during the anhepatic periods were higher in the CDLT group (p < 0.05). However, transfusion requirement in the ICU were higher in LDLT group [6.9 +/- 2.2 (n = 6) vs. 18.6 +/- 19 (n = 11) mL/kg, p < 0.05] after LT. As a result of this study in a pediatric patient population, no statistical significance was found in whole blood transfusion and FFP requirements between CDLT and LDLT. Duration of the operation was the primary factor effecting transfusion volume showing the importance of continued small volume losses during uncomplicated LT in this small sized patient population.

However, there are no data about its usage in neonatal ECMO. This study aimed to analyze transfusion requirements for all newborns on ECMO anticoagulated with bivalirudin. Methods: Retrospective chart review study of neonatal patients (≤28 days old at ECMO initiation) receiving ECMO from February-2018 to November-2022 in a large tertiary pediatric hospital. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U-test using MS-Excel 2016; data is presented as mean±SD, with significance at p<0.05. Results: There were 26 newborns in the ICU treated with bivalirudin while on VA-ECMO (Table) with 16 of them started initially on heparin for 4.2±4.6 days, then switched to bivalirudin for 7.9±4.1 days; total length was 12.2±5.9 days with survival rate of 44%. The total transfusion volume of red blood cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate was not significantly lower on bivalirudin when compared to heparin: 127±56 vs 161±72 mL/day, p=0.14 as well as after adjustment per weight at birth 41.1±14.4 vs 56.5±37.6 mL/kg/day, p=0.11. Ten newborns on VA-ECMO were started with bivalirudin directly for 5.4±5.1 days with survival rate of 50%; total daily transfusion was similar to the previous group 138±34 mL/day and 46.4±11.2 mL/kg/day. ECMO survivors (n=12) required fewer total transfusions during bivalirudin anticoagulation (117±38 vs 144±53 mL/day, p=0.13), that was statistically significant after weight adjusting (37.2±11.3 vs 48.2±13.1 mL/kg/day, p=0.033), due to decreased platelet transfusion requirements (11.5±6.3 vs 17.1±7.2 mL/kg/ day, p=0.06), possibly due to high incidence of bleeding complications (5 of 14) among non-survivors. Conclusions: The use of bivalirudin as a rescue to heparin in neonatal ECMO was associated with a decrease in total daily blood transfusion volume by onefourth. Non-survivors of ECMO on bivalirudin were transfused with higher load of blood products (mostly platelets) to mitigate bleeding complications. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the use of bivalirudin anticoagulation instead of heparin in neonatal ECMO reduces the overall need for blood transfusions.

bfbe3bc5-94fa-483a-afe9-edc08a5cbdbc,The Effect of Patient-Specific Cerebral Oxygenation Monitoring on Postoperative Cognitive Function: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"['Ellis, L', 'Murphy, GJ', 'Culliford, L', 'Dreyer, L', 'Clayton, G', 'Downes, R', 'Nicholson, E', 'Stoica, S', 'Reeves, BC', 'Rogers, CA']",JMIR Research Protocols,4,4,e137,"BACKGROUND: Indices of global tissue oxygen delivery and utilization such as mixed venous oxygen saturation, serum lactate concentration, and arterial hematocrit are commonly used to determine the adequacy of tissue oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, these global measures may not accurately reflect regional tissue oxygenation and ischemic organ injury remains a common and serious complication of CPB. Near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technology that measures regional tissue oxygenation. NIRS may be used alongside global measures to optimize regional perfusion and reduce organ injury. It may also be used as an indicator of the need for red blood cell transfusion in the presence of anemia and tissue hypoxia. However, the clinical benefits of using NIRS remain unclear and there is a lack of high‐quality evidence demonstrating its efficacy and cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the patient‐specific cerebral oxygenation monitoring as part of an algorithm to reduce transfusion during heart valve surgery (PASPORT) trial is to determine whether the addition of NIRS to CPB management algorithms can prevent cognitive decline, postoperative organ injury, unnecessary transfusion, and reduce health care costs. METHODS: Adults aged 16 years or older undergoing valve or combined coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery at one of three UK cardiac centers (Bristol, Hull, or Leicester) are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either a standard algorithm for optimizing tissue oxygenation during CPB that includes a fixed transfusion threshold, or a patient‐specific algorithm that incorporates cerebral NIRS monitoring and a restrictive red blood cell transfusion threshold. Allocation concealment, Internet‐based randomization stratified by operation type and recruiting center, and blinding of patients, ICU and ward care staff, and outcome assessors reduce the risk of bias. The primary outcomes are cognitive function 3 months after surgery and infectious complications during the first 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes include measures of inflammation, organ injury, and volumes of blood transfused. The cost effectiveness of the NIRS‐based algorithm is described in terms of a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve. The trial tests the superiority of the patient‐specific algorithm versus standard care. A sample size of 200 patients was chosen to detect a small to moderate target difference with 80% power and 5% significance (two tailed). RESULTS: Over 4 years, 208 patients have been successfully randomized and have been followed up for a 3‐month period. Results are to be reported in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides high‐quality evidence, both valid and widely applicable, to determine whether the use of NIRS monitoring as part of a patient‐specific management algorithm improves clinical outcomes and is cost effective.

Results: Intentional fetal/neonatal demise occurred in 9.8% (110/1,122) of fetuses and was due to termination of pregnancy (2.2%), selective fetal reduction (4.2%), or withdrawal of neonatal intensive care (3.4%). Reasons for termination of pregnancy included complications of laser treatment (72.0%), severe fetal anomaly (20.0%), and unwanted pregnancy (8.0%). Reasons for selective fetal reduction were technical difficulties to perform laser surgery (51.1%), fetal complications (38.3%), and parental preference for fetal reduction rather than laser treatment (10.6%).

With a focus on critical care, the authors studied the impact of complications to highlight predictors of poor postoperative outcomes in order to implement optimization protocols. Methods: This case-control study analyzed the relationship between perioperative variables and postoperative medical and surgical complications of patients who underwent head and neck surgery using fibular and forearm free flaps. The primary objective was the incidence of prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). Secondary objectives were the incidence of ICU readmissions, postoperative infections, and 1-year mortality. A univariable logistic regression model was used. A study of mortality was performed with survival analysis. Regarding our primary objective, we performed a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and a multivariable Poisson regression with defined variables of interest. Results: The data of 118 hospital stays were included. Prolonged ICU LOS was observed in 47% of cases and was associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumopathies, intraoperative blood transfusion, and surgical duration. Medical and surgical complications were associated with prolonged ICU LOS. After the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, infectious complications, complications, major complications, total number of pneumopathies, and operative time remained significant. At least one complication was experienced by 71% of patients during the hospitalization, and 33% of patients suffered from major complications. Infectious complications were the most common (40% of patients) and were mainly caused by pneumonia (25% of patients); these complications were associated with low preoperative hemoglobin level, intraoperative blood transfusion, accumulation of reversible cardiovascular risk factors, chronic alcohol consumption, and duration of surgery. Pneumonia was specifically associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The ICU readmission rate was 10% and was associated with lower preoperative hemoglobin level, pneumopathies, surgical duration, and use of a fibular flap. The 1-year mortality was 12%, and the survival analysis showed no association with prolonged ICU LOS. Poisson regression showed that ICU LOS was prolonged by smoking history, lower preoperative hemoglobin level, intraoperative blood transfusion, major complication, and pneumopathies.

However, the incidence and associated causes of ARDS in isolated TBI have not been well studied. METHODS: We performed a subgroup analysis of 210 consecutive patients with isolated severe TBI enrolled in a prospective observational cohort at a Level 1 trauma center between 2005 and 2014. Subjects required endotracheal intubation and had isolated severe TBI defined by a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or greater and AIS score lower than 3 in all other categories. ARDS within the first 8 days of admission was rigorously adjudicated using Berlin criteria. Regression analyses were used to test the association between predictors of interest and ARDS. RESULTS: The incidence of ARDS in the first 8 days after severe isolated TBI was 30%. Patients who developed ARDS were administered more crystalloids (4.3 L vs. 3.5 L, p = 0.005) and blood products in the first 12 hours of admission. Patients with ARDS had significantly worse clinical outcomes measured at 28 days, including longer median intensive care unit and hospital stays (4 days vs. 13 days, p < 0.001, and 7.5 days vs. 14.5 days, p < 0.001, respectively). In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, the odds of developing ARDS were significantly associated with head AIS score (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; p = 0.018), male sex (OR, 2.9; p = 0.012), and early transfusion of platelets (OR, 2.8; p = 0.003). These associations were similar in a multivariate logistic regression model. CONCLUSION: In the era of balanced hemostatic resuscitation practices, severity of head injury, male sex, early crystalloids, and early transfusion of platelets are associated with a higher risk of ARDS after severe isolated TBI. Early transfusion of platelets after severe TBI may be a modifiable risk factor for ARDS, and these findings invite further investigation into causal mechanisms driving this observed association.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies, in people having various cardiac surgery operations, found strong associations of RBC transfusion with mortality and postoperative morbidity. The effect on mortality was strongest close to the time of operation but extended to 5 years. Morbidity outcomes included serious wound and systemic infections, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, low cardiac index, myocardial infarction, and stroke. RBC transfusion was also strongly associated with increased cardiac intensive care unit and ward postoperative stay, and hence, increased cost of admission; available studies did not consider all resources used and the associated costs. SUMMARY: The harms of RBC transfusion have potentially serious and long-term consequences for patients and are costly for health services. This evidence should shift clinicians' equipoise towards more restrictive transfusion practice. The immediate aim should be to avoid transfusing a small number of RBC units for general malaise attributed to anaemia, a practice that appears to occur in about 50% of transfused patients. Randomized trials comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion triggers are urgently needed to directly compare the benefits and harms from RBC transfusion.",2008,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0b013e328310fc95,"{""pmid"": 18830077, ""electronic_issn"": ""1531-7080"", ""linking_issn"": ""0268-4705"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""8608087"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2008 Nov"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2008-10-03""}}"

A dual case-control investigation of multitransfused cardiac surgery patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenated patients in intensive care unit,"['Muir, M.R.', 'Gerrard, C.', 'Besser, M.']",British Journal of Haematology,165,,21,"The leucoerythroblastic blood picture (LEB) has been associated with a poor prognostic outcome. Previous studies have examined nucleated red blood cell counts in the context of medical and general surgical intensive care units but none so far have considered specifically high mortality risk groups. This study focuses on multitransfused cardiac patients and those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for reversible but potentially fatal lung and/or heart failure. The objective of this dual case-control study was to determine whether the nucleated red cell count as representative of LEB status was a strong enough marker to distinguish those who would die from those who survived in two specific patient groups already with a high mortality risk. By examining 106 multi-transfused surgical cardiac patients (CMT) and 88 adult patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from a 3 year sampling period, this study found that although LEB indicated a more severe degree of critical illness, it was not an independent predictor of mortality. LEB was significantly associated with hypoxia, prolonged cross-clamp time, the co-presence of infective organisms and increased red cell and platelet transfusion demands in the CMT group. In the ECMO group, the key associations were with hypoxia and lactic acidosis, duration of ECMO circuit exposure and increased red cell and platelet transfusion demand. The implications of this study are that patients showing an LEB should have a septic screen considered and that improved technological means for detecting nucleated red cells may benefit patients through earlier warning to the clinicians as to the severity of the critical illness. The conclusion of this study was that LEB was a response to a compound physiological insult but in these patient groups already with a high mortality risk the nucleated red cell count was not an independent predictor of mortality.",2014/05//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1662363903?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1662363903; 71802709"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""surgical patient"", ""membrane"", ""heart surgery"", ""critical illness"", ""society"", ""cardiac patient"", ""high risk population"", ""patient"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""intensive care unit"", ""human"", ""clamp"", ""hypoxia"", ""heart failure"", ""extracorporeal oxygenation"", ""sampling"", ""lactic acidosis"", ""risk factor"", ""blood"", ""erythrocyte"", ""case control study"", ""lung"", ""hematology"", ""exposure"", ""marker"", ""mortality"", ""adult"", ""erythrocyte count""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjh.12802"", ""issn"": ""00071048"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Blood Sciences, Cambridge University Hospitals, Papworth Hospital, Papworth, United Kingdom , Anaesthetic Department, Papworth Hospital, Papworth, United Kingdom , Blood Sciences, Cambridge University Hospitals, Papworth Hospital, Papworth, United Kingdom, Muir, M.R., Blood Sciences, Cambridge University Hospitals, Papworth Hospital, Papworth, United Kingdom"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 54th Annual Scientific Meeting of the British Society for Haematology"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2015-03-04"", ""Date revised - 2015-03-12"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=British+Journal+of+Haematology&rft.atitle=Investigation+of+leucoerythroblastic+blood+picture+as+a+risk+factor+for+mortality.+A+dual+case-control+investigation+of+multitransfused+cardiac+surgery+patients+and+extracorporeal+membrane+oxygenated+patients+in+intensive+care+unit&rft.au=Muir%2C+M.R.&rft.aulast=Muir&rft.aufirst=M.R.&rft.date=2014-05-01&rft.volume=165&rft.issue=&rft.spage=21&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=British+Journal+of+Haematology&rft.issn=00071048&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fbjh.12802"", ""date"": ""May 2014""}"

The aim of this single-center retrospective observational cohort pilot study was to evaluate whether the use of AF was associated with reduced blood loss in infants undergoing EAC. The authors hypothesized that there would be no difference in blood loss between patients who received AF and those that did not receive AF during EAC. Non-syndromic patients who underwent single-suture EAC were retrospectively evaluated. Primary outcome measure was intraoperative calculated blood loss (mL/kg). Secondary outcome measures included perioperative red blood cells transfusion volumes, number of blood donor exposures, and pediatric intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay. Study cohort demographic and outcome data were analyzed; Fisher exact test was used for categorical data, Student t test was used for continuous data. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Forty-nine EAC patients were included in the study with 34 patients in the AF cohort and 15 patients in the non-AF cohort. There were no significant differences in demographics between the 2 groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in intraoperative calculated blood loss or any secondary outcome measure.

We describe the epidemiology and associations of acute kidney injury (AKI) in Jamaicans hospitalized with SCD. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of admissions with coded diagnoses of SCD between January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 at the University Hospital of the West Indies was performed. Exclusion criteria were age < 1 month or if less than two creatinines were available. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) as either an increase of at least 1.5 times baseline creatinine if known. If baseline creatinine was unavailable this was defined as an increase of 1.5 times the maximum creatinine to the lowest creatinine in the admission. The index admission for each case was analysed. Data were described using summary statistics. Differences between AKI and non-AKI groups were performed using chi-square or t-tests were appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associated factors with AKI. Results: Of 144 participants, mean age 27.0 ±15.4 years, 62.2% were female and 84.5% Hemoglobin-SS genotype. One third (n=48) of participants were children (age<18 years). AKI occurred in 19.4% (n=28). The main admitting diagnoses were vaso-occulsive crises in 61.1%, Acute chest syndrome 27.8%, Lower Respiratory Tract Infection 17.4%, hepatic sequestration 13.2%. Baseline CKD was reported in 6.3%, hydroxyurea use in 4.9% and NSAID use 20.1%. Three participants were admitted to the intensive care unit. There were no in-hospital deaths. Mean duration of hospitalization was 8.8±8.3 days(range:1-59 days). A quarter of patients (26.4%) had red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, exchange transfusion was performed in 2 children. Compared to no AKI, AKI participants were older (mean age 32.1 ±14.9 versus 25.8 ±15.4 years, p=0.05), with a higher proportion receiving RBC transfusion (46% versus 21.6%, p=0.007). Based on a logistic regression model adjusting for age and sex, RBC transfusion was associated with AKI in adults (OR 3.1 95% CI: 1.1-8.6, p=0.003), but not children (OR: 0.5 95%CI 0.04-6.5, p=0.612). There was no difference in length of hospital stay in AKI and non AKI groups. Conclusions: AKI frequently complicates admissions with sickle cell disease.

Exchange transfusion is not a common treatment for viremia, and, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of exchange transfusion on viral load in congenital cytomegalovirus infection has not been previously reported. Therefore, to study the effect of exchange transfusion on viral load in a neonate with severe congenital cytomegalovirus infection and hyperbilirubinemia, the plasma viral load of cytomegalovirus was measured before and after exchange transfusion by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patient A Japanese girl was delivered at 36 weeks of gestation to a 29-year-old gravida 3 para 3 by emergency Cesarean section because of non-reassuring fetal status. The patient's measurements at birth were: weight 1792 g (third percentile), length 43.5 cm (tenth percentile), and head circumference 29.6 cm (tenth percentile), respectively. The mother's cytomegalovirus immunoglobulins M and G were positive (7.43 mg/dL and 27.4 mg/dL, respectively). Her cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M was positive (4.63 mg/dL). On day 0, exchange transfusion was performed for hyperbilirubinemia. After exchange transfusion, total bilirubin was decreased to 7.5 mg/dL, and phototherapy was continued. She was then transferred to our tertiary-referral neonatal intensive care unit on day 2 of life for antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir at a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day was used from day 1 to day 49, and valganciclovir at a dosage of 32 mg/kg/day was used from day 50. Methods Red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets were used for exchange transfusion, which was performed using 2 separate catheters (continuous technique). The total blood volume of exchange transfusion was 163 mL/kg. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in plasma samples obtained before and after exchange transfusion. Results Before exchange transfusion, the patient's plasma cytomegalovirus DNA levels were markedly elevated 8.7×105/mL. After exchange transfusion, the cytomegalovirus DNA level was not significantly decreased at 4.3×105/mL. On day 0 and day 1, cytomegalovirus DNA levels in urine were 3.3×108 /mL and 3.3×109 /mL, respectively. Discussion Cytomegalovirus has affinity for many human organs, such as liver, spleen, brain, and others. In the present case, it seemed that the cytomegalovirus invaded into many organs because constitutional symptoms such as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and leptocephaly were noted at birth. Therefore, systemic organs might release cytomegalovirus, and the viral load of cytomegalovirus was not significantly decreased after exchange transfusion. Conclusion Exchange transfusion did not reduce the viral load of cytomegalovirus in severe congenital cytomegalovirus infection.",2013/06//,Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

The view that RBC transfusion is risk-free is no longer tenable today. There is the accumulating evidence that allogeneic blood transfusion is immunosuppressive. More recently, attention has focused on the age of RBCs transfused. Transfused RBCs, especially during the time period immediately following transfusion, are not normal. The duration of RBC storage may be an important determinant of the efficacy of RBCs as oxygen carriers as well as a determinant of transfusion related morbidity. Adding to the controversy about risk/benefit ratio for RBC transfusion are recent data showing that an aggressive RBC transfusion strategy may decrease the likelihood of survival in selected subpopulations of critically ill adults. The optimal hematocrit for the ICU patient remains to be determined. It seems clear that hemoglobin levels falling significantly below the ""10/30"" threshold can be tolerated. However, it is not clear that this is applicable to the critically ill ICU patient population. Therefore, while hemoglobin levels in the 7-10 mg/dL range are well tolerated in the ""stable"" ""nonstressed"" patient, this range might not be optimal for the critically ill patient.

To the best of our knowledge, no trial exists that investigated the effect of platelet transfusion in combination with the administration of balanced vWF in severe blood loss, despite being widely used in clinical practice. The Basel Will-Plate study will investigate the impact of the timely administration of balanced vWF (1:1 vWF and FVIII) in addition to platelet transfusion on the need for blood and coagulation factor transfusion in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who suffer from severe bleeding. The study hypothesis is based on the assumption that adding balanced vWF to platelets will reduce the overall need for transfusion of blood products compared to the transfusion of platelets alone. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Will-Plate study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, double-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial in 120 critically ill patients needing platelet transfusion. The primary outcome measure will be the number of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions according to groups. Secondary outcome measures include the number of platelet concentrates transfused within the first 48 h after treatment of study medication, quantity of blood loss in the first 48 h after treatment with the study medication, length of stay in ICU and hospital, number of revision surgeries for haemorrhage control, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality. Patients will be followed after 30 days and 1 year for activities of daily living and mortality assessment. The sample size was calculated to detect a 50% reduction in the number of blood products subsequently transfused within 2 days in patients with Wilate® compared to placebo. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland and will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-GCP or ISO EN 14155 (as far as applicable) and all national legal and regulatory requirements.

Postpartum hemorrhage remains most common direct cause for maternal mortality and the most common indirect causes are anemia, preeclampsia, and sepsis in India. The main objective of our study is to determine the incidence and indications of blood and blood products transfusion in women admitted for obstetric care and to assess the timing and type of transfusion. Materials and methods: Type of study: Cross-sectional Study The study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Railway Headquarters Hospital, Ayanavaram, Chennai, over 18 months between December 2017 and May 2019. The study area includes all the women admitted in antenatal, labor, postnatal wards, ICU, those seeking an abortion, and emergency inpatient services of obstetrics. Results: The incidence of blood and blood products transfusion was 2.4%. Postpartum hemorrhage followed by anemia complicating pregnancy is the commonest cause for the need for transfusion. Conclusions: Vigilant monitoring during the fourth stage of labor for early identification of signs and symptoms of ongoing acute bleeding in the diagnosis of obstetric hemorrhage is recommended. All pregnant women should be counseled regarding the intake of an iron-rich diet and factors affecting iron absorption, and compliance to oral iron supplementations so that hemoglobin could be optimized well in advance, thus avoiding a situation requiring blood transfusion. Each institute should have its transfusion protocol and audits which will aid in identifying triggers for transfusion, to ensure quality transfusion practices.",2023///Nov 2023 - Dec,Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2900373670?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2900373670; 2026871863"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Anemia"", ""Blood transfusion"", ""Obstetric care"", ""Postpartum hemorrhage"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""iron"", ""14093-02-8"", ""53858-86-9"", ""7439-89-6"", ""Embase"", ""10:Obstetrics and Gynecology"", ""29:Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry"", ""25:Hematology"", ""iron absorption"", ""obstetric procedure"", ""abortion"", ""bleeding"", ""ectopic pregnancy"", ""primigravida"", ""thrombocytopenia"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""major clinical study"", ""Article"", ""HELLP syndrome"", ""hysterectomy"", ""amnion fluid embolism"", ""uterus inversion"", ""multigravida"", ""cross-sectional study"", ""diet"", ""female"", ""vaginal delivery"", ""human"", ""obstetric hemorrhage"", ""postpartum hemorrhage"", ""blood transfusion"", ""human experiment"", ""preeclampsia"", ""maternal hypertension"", ""anemia"", ""cesarean section"", ""antepartum hemorrhage"", ""iron -- endogenous compound"", ""sepsis""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10006-2352"", ""issn"": ""09748938"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Orthopaedics, Smt.

This study was developed to explore the outcomes of aortic surgical procedures conducted via a partial upper sternotomy or a full median sternotomy approach in obese patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined consecutive acute type A aortic dissection patients who underwent aortic surgery in our hospital between January 2015 to January 2021. Patients were divided into two groups based on body mass index: 'non-obese' and 'obese'. We then further stratified patients in the obese and non-obese groups into partial upper sternotomy and full median sternotomy groups, with outcomes between these two sternotomy groups then being compared within and between these two body mass index groups. RESULTS: In total, records for 493 patients that had undergone aortic surgery were retrospectively reviewed, leading to the identification of 158 consecutive obese patients and 335 non-obese patients. Overall, 88 and 70 obese patients underwent full median sternotomy and partial upper sternotomy, respectively, while 180 and 155 non-obese patients underwent these respective procedures. There were no differences between the full median sternotomy and partial upper sternotomy groups within either BMI cohort with respect to preoperative baseline indicators and postoperative complications. Among non-obese individuals, the partial upper sternotomy approach was associated with reduced ventilation time (P = 0.003), shorter intensive care unit stay (P = 0.017), shorter duration of hospitalization (P = 0.001), and decreased transfusion requirements (Packed red blood cells: P < 0.001; Fresh frozen plasma: P < 0.001). Comparable findings were also evident among obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Obese aortic disease patients exhibited beneficial outcomes similar to those achieved for non-obese patients via a partial upper sternotomy approach which was associated with significant reductions in the duration of intensive care unit residency, duration of hospitalization, ventilator use, and transfusion requirements. This surgical approach should thus be offered to aortic disease patients irrespective of their body mass index.",2022/05/31/,NLM (Medline),['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2673398151?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2673398151; 638141020"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Aortic"", ""BMI"", ""Minimally invasive"", ""Obese"", ""Partial upper sternotomy"", ""MEDLINE"", ""fresh frozen plasma"", ""aortic valve"", ""complication"", ""sternotomy"", ""minimally invasive surgery"", ""procedures"", ""aortic disease -- etiology"", ""human"", ""treatment outcome"", ""obesity"", ""retrospective study"", ""surgery""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13019-022-01890-y"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Cardiac Disease Center, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350001, China chenliangwan0782@163.com, Department of Cardiology, Nan Ping First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Nanping, 353000, China , Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Cardiac Disease Center, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350001, China"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"", ""Date created - 2022-06-07"", ""Date revised - 2022-06-07"", ""Last updated - 2022-06-07""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+cardiothoracic+surgery&rft.atitle=Surgical+outcomes+associated+with+partial+upper+sternotomy+in+obese+aortic+disease+patients&rft.au=Luo%2C+Zeng-Rong&rft.aulast=Luo&rft.aufirst=Zeng-Rong&rft.date=2022-05-31&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=135&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+cardiothoracic+surgery&rft.issn=&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs13019-022-01890-y"", ""date"": ""2022 May 31""}"

Although technically complex, recent case studies showed that minimally invasive approaches to esophagectomy are feasible and have the potential to improve mortality, hospital stay, and functional outcome. METHODS: We have performed a case controlled pair‐matched study comparing 62 patients who had undergone either minimally invasive (MIE) or open esophagectomy (OE) between 2004 and 2007. Patients were matched by tumor stage and localization, sex, age, and preoperative ASA score. Pathologic stage, operative time, blood loss, transfusion requirements, hospital length of stay, postoperative morbidity, and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were seen in the overall number of patients with surgical morbidity (MIE: 25% vs. OE: 74%, p = 0.014), the transfusion rate (MIE: 12.9% vs. OE: 41.9%, p = 0.001), and the rate of postoperative respiratory complications (MIE: 9.7% vs. OE: 38.7%, p = 0.008). There was no difference with respect to the duration of surgery. The number of resected lymph nodes and rate of pathologic complete resection were comparable. ICU stay [MIE: 3 days (range = 0‐15) vs. OE: 6 days (range = 1‐40), p = 0.03] and hospital stay [MIE: 12 days (range = 8‐46) vs. OE: 24 days (range = 10‐79), p = 0.001] were significantly shorter in the MIE group. CONCLUSION: The results of this case‐controlled study provide further evidence for the feasibility and possible improvements in the postoperative morbidity of minimally invasive esophagectomy. Our data are comparable to those from other centers and lead us to initiate the first prospectively randomized study comparing the morbidity of total minimally invasive esophagectomy with the open technique.",2010,PUBMED 20464423,['https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00772981/full'],"{""accession_number"": ""CN-00772981"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Journal article"", ""keywords"": [""Adult"", ""Aged"", ""Case‐Control Studies"", ""Esophageal Neoplasms [*surgery]"", ""Esophagectomy [*methods]"", ""Esophagoscopy"", ""Female"", ""Humans"", ""Male"", ""Middle Aged"", ""Prospective Studies""], ""doi"": ""10.1007/s00464-010-1083-1""}"

There is open repair (OR) by means of the vascular prosthesis implantation or the less invasive endovascular method by means of the stent graft implantation through femoral arteries incision (EndovascularAorticRepair - EVAR). The aim of the study was the evaluation of the postoperative course in patients operated due to the aortic abdominal aneurysm and the evaluation of the impact of the surgical method on the short-time results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 124 patients operated due to the abdominal aortic aneurysm in Dept of Surgery of 4th Military Hospital in Wroclaw in 2014 were enrolled into the study: 53 patients with OR, 53 patients with EVAR, and 19 patients with a ruptured aneurysm. RESULTS: Mortality was 0% in EVAR and 6% in OR and 39% in a ruptured aneurysm. Time of hospital stay was 5.8 days in EVAR vs 10 days in OR. The stay in ICU was 0% in EVAR vs 13% in OR. Blood transfusion was 9.4% in EVAR vs 66% in OR. Time of postoperative analgesia was 27 h in EVAR vs 76.8 h in OR. Cardio-respiratory decompensation was 1.9% in EVAR vs 7.6% in OR. Renal insufficiency was 2% in EVAR vs 9% in OR. The lower rate of organ complications was in EVAR. The ruptured aneurysm presented the most complicated postoperative course: hospital stay of 11.4 days, ICU stay of 78%, blood transfusion of 100%, painkillers of 136 hours, cardio-respiratory decompensation of 81% and renal insufficiency of 69%. CONCLUSIONS: The method of treatment, the conditions of the admission and the type of surgery influenced the postoperative course.

Most blood withdrawn is not required for analysis and is discarded. Objective: To determine whether transitioning from standard-volume to small-volume vacuum tubes for blood collection in ICUs reduces RBC transfusion without compromising laboratory testing procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in 25 adult medical-surgical ICUs in Canada (February 5, 2019 to January 21, 2021). Interventions: ICUs were randomized to transition from standard-volume (n = 10940) to small-volume tubes (n = 10261) for laboratory testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was RBC transfusion (units per patient per ICU stay). Secondary outcomes were patients receiving at least 1 RBC transfusion, hemoglobin decrease during ICU stay (adjusted for RBC transfusion), specimens with insufficient volume for testing, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and mortality in the ICU and hospital. The primary analysis included patients admitted for 48 hours or more, excluding those admitted during a 5.5-month COVID-19-related trial hiatus. Results: In the primary analysis of 21201 patients (mean age, 63.5 years; 39.9% female), which excluded 6210 patients admitted during the early COVID-19 pandemic, there was no significant difference in RBC units per patient per ICU stay (relative risk [RR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.05]; P =.19; absolute reduction of 7.24 RBC units/100 patients per ICU stay [95% CI, -3.28 to 19.44]). In a prespecified secondary analysis (n = 27411 patients), RBC units per patient per ICU stay decreased after transition from standard-volume to small-volume tubes (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00]; P =.04; absolute reduction of 9.84 RBC units/100 patients per ICU stay [95% CI, 0.24 to 20.76]). Median decrease in transfusion-adjusted hemoglobin was not statistically different in the primary population (mean difference, 0.10 g/dL [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.23]) and lower in the secondary population (mean difference, 0.17 g/dL [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.29]). Specimens with insufficient quantity for analysis were rare (≤0.03%) before and after transition.

7137c78d-3562-4fa7-851e-f8cc75ac8141,Comparative Study of Laparoscopic Versus Open Operations for Colon Cancer,"['NCT00202111,']",https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00202111,,,,"AIMS The primary aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that tumour related disease free interval and overall survival are equivalent regardless whether patients receive laparoscopic colon resection (LCR) or open colon resection (OCR) at three and five years post operatively. The secondary aims of the study are to determine the safety of LCR compared to OCR and 30 day mortality and compare post operative pain, paralytic ileus, early and late morbidities (including wound site recurrence), recovery, transfusion requirements, cost and quality of life scores. BACKGROUND The ALCCaS Trial is an Australasian, multicentred, prospective, randomised clinical study comparing laparoscopic and conventional open surgical treatments of colon cancer in adults. This trial has been recruiting patients since 1998. Patients are randomised to receive either laparoscopic or conventional open resection for colon cancer. A Randomisation Centre was established to provide a 24‐hour randomisation service and this centre is situated in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Health Research Council of New Zealand Data Safety Committee, chaired by Professor Tom Fleming, access the ALCCaS Trial annually to ensure that it meets strict ethical and research related criteria. During the recruitment period (Jan 1998 to March 2005) 601 patients were recruited into the ALCCaS Trial. There have been 37 surgeons involved in recruiting patients at 20 hospitals within Australia and New Zealand. All surgeons participating in the ALCCaS trial are accredited in laparoscopic surgical techniques. To gain accreditation, a surgeon must have carried out no less than 20 supervised colon resections and must provide video evidence of two laparoscopic colonic resections for review. Surgeons from throughout Australia and New Zealand are participating in this study. The Research Ethics Committees at a variety of hospitals throughout New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and New Zealand have approved the study. DATA COLLECTION The use of cytotoxic irrigation of the peritoneum, wound and colonic lumen is noted. Estimated surgical blood loss and intra operative blood transfusion is recorded. The post operative position of the tumour is noted. The type of incision and size of incision is recorded. Any reason for change in planned incision is recorded and the theatre utilisation, and total anaesthetic time and duration of the operative procedure are recorded. Intra operative temperature record is kept. Reason for stoma formation, if applicable, is recorded. The intra operative costs and disposable items are identified. Intra operative complications are identified as well as adverse events involving surgical equipment. In the post operative phase the total intravenous fluid requirement, blood transfusion, pain scores, amount of Morphine used, whether the patient vomited and whether nasogastric tube is required as well as lung function tests and any adverse events are noted at 30 minutes following the procedure, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 168 hours and continued daily until the patient is discharged if not already discharged at that time. At discharge from hospital, total hospital days are identified as well as time in high dependency unit or intensive care unit, reason for delay in discharge is noted, post operative events including cardiac, respiratory, renal, ileus, wound infection, anastomotic leakage and other events are identified. FOLLOW‐UP SCHEDULE Frequency of Follow‐up: The minimum number of follow‐up evaluations is as follows: ‐ every 3 months for the lst year. ‐ every 6 months for the 2nd and 3rd years. ‐ annually for the 4th and 5th years. Test Schedule: The minimal requirements for follow‐up investigations are as follows: The type of colon resection performed by the individual surgeon will follow standard oncologically safe principles. The following intra‐operative details will be collected, the patient epidemiology, ASA status, previous abdominal surgery, incision type, site of carcinoma, modality of diagnosis, pre operative haemoglobin and lung function tests, pre operative blood transfusion, planned operation, planned incision. Intra operatively the date of the operation, whether DVT prophylaxis has been used, the type of bowel preparation, the type of operation performed, if the laparoscopic procedure is performed whether it included mobilisation of the bowel, ligation of main artery and vein, transection of the bowel, resection of the bowel and anastomosis done as an intraperitoneal procedure are recorded. Pathology includes the site of tumour, TNM staging, ACPS staging, length of resected colon, proximal clearance, distal clearance, number of nodes obtained, tumour differentiation, venous invasion, perineal invasion and histological type. Adjuvant chemotherapy if planned is noted. Patients in the study may be entered into an adjuvant chemotherapy trial following surgery provided the subsequent trial does not have radiation as a component of therapy and that the chemotherapy trial allows entering of patients from both surgical arms of the study. Follow up is quarterly for the first year, 6 monthly for year two and three and then annually until year five. At follow up wounds are check for any evidence of recurrence. A colonoscopy is performed 12 months following resection and then every three years following that if negative. Chest xray, abdominal CT or liver ultrasound, a complete blood picture are performed if clinically indicated, CEA’s performed six monthly. Patients are followed for tumour recurrence and survival. Patients are advised on, and offered standard treatment with, adjuvant therapy. Follow‐up is standardised to provide accurate data on recurrence and survival and more frequent examinations and investigations are performed if clinically indicated. ‐ History and examination with a specific check for tumour wound recurrence. ‐ Colon evaluation including colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema. ‐ Annual examination if positive for neoplasia (earlier if preoperative proximal examination is incomplete for technical reasons); examination every 3 years if negative. ‐ haemoglobin and white cell count ‐ creatinine, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, CEA ‐ Chest X‐ray ‐ Abdominal CT scan or liver ultrasound annually for 5 years. ‐ Quality of Life and Complications documentation postoperatively at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months and 18 months. SIGNIFICANCE AND OUTCOMES The study will determine the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic assisted resection of colonic adenocarcinoma. It will also answer questions of cost effectiveness and quality of life improvement. It will determine if port site recurrence is a real issue in this type of surgery. The study will also give valuable data about the outcomes of patients undergoing laparotomy in regard to current length of hospital stay, effectiveness of post‐operative analgesia, in hospital complications and transfusion requirements.",2005,CTgov NCT00202111,['https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02013398/full'],"{""accession_number"": ""CN-02013398"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Trial registry record"", ""keywords"": [""Colonic Neoplasms""]}"

Our aim was to describe the current use of FFP transfusion in medical patients with septic shock. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of medical patients with septic shock (n = 60) admitted to two general intensive care units (ICUs) during a three-month period. Patients were divided into two groups, one received FFP transfusion, the other did not. Baseline characteristics, transfusions and outcome were compared between the groups. Episodes of bleeding, procedures and coagulation parameters were compared between days with and without FFP transfusion. RESULTS: 57% of the patients received a median of six (interquartile range: 3-10) units of FFP during their ICU stay. The FFP-transfused patients had higher sequential organ failure assessment scores at admission (13 (9-15) versus 10 (7-11), p = 0.02) than the untransfused patients, but there were no differences in simplified acute physiology score II or mortality. On days of FFP transfusion, international normalized ratio levels (1.8 (1.4-2.3) versus 1.3 (1.2-1.6), p < 0.0001) were higher, and invasive procedures (p < 0.0001), episodes of bleeding (p < 0.0001), transfusion of red blood cells (p < 0.0001) and platelets (p < 0.0001) more frequent than on days without transfusion. Two thirds of FFP transfusions were given to patients with clinical evidence of bleeding and/or as prophylaxis before invasive procedures.

METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized, multicentre trial. A total of 13 intensive care units participated, and a total of 148 patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous iron saccharate alone (control group), intravenous iron saccharate and subcutaneous rHuEPO 40,000 units once per week (group A), or intravenous iron saccharate and subcutaneous rHuEPO 40,000 units three times per week (group B). rHuEPO was given for a minimum of 2 weeks or until discharge from the intensive care unit or death. The maximum duration of therapy was 3 weeks. RESULTS: The cumulative number of RBC units transfused, the average numbers of RBC units transfused per patient and per transfused patient, the average volume of RBCs transfused per day, and the percentage of transfused patients were significantly higher in the control group than in groups A and B. No significant difference was observed between group A and B. The mean increases in Hct and Hb from baseline to final measurement were significantly greater in group B than in the control group. The mean increase in Hct was significantly greater in group B than in group A. The mean increase in Hct in group A was significantly greater than that in control individuals, whereas the mean increase in Hb did not differ significantly between the control group and group A.

She was admitted to the neurocritical care unit for the treatment of status epilepticus. Metabolic, infectious and toxic work-up were unremarkable except for an elevated lactate. MRI of the brain with contrast showed extensive bilateral hemispheric and cerebellar white matter T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) hyperintensities with areas of enhancement. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram was performed to evaluate for a vascular etiology and revealed focal segmental stenoses in bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and in branches of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. These findings were suggestive of RCVS.

However, due to deleterious side effects and questionable efficacy, the clinical benefit of RBCT in patients who are not actively bleeding is unclear. The results of randomized controlled trials suggest there is no benefit to a liberal transfusion practice in general critical care populations. Whether the results of these trials are applicable to brain injured patients is unknown, as patients with primary neurological injury were excluded. This article reviews the efficacy and complications of RBCT, as well as the relationship between RBCT and its outcome in both the general intensive care unit and neurologically critically ill populations. © 2011 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",2012/01//,"Springer New York, 233 Spring Street, NY 10013-1578",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/921269754?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""921269754; 364191527"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Review"", ""keywords"": [""Anemia"", ""Erythrocytes"", ""Hemoglobin"", ""ICU"", ""Neurocritical care"", ""Transfusion"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""29:Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry"", ""25:Hematology"", ""8:Neurology and Neurosurgery"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""bleeding"", ""antigen presentation"", ""transfusion related acute lung injury"", ""transfusion"", ""review"", ""intensive care unit"", ""outcome assessment"", ""injury"", ""alloimmunization"", ""multicenter study (topic)"", ""hypotension"", ""transfusion associated graft versus host disease"", ""side effect"", ""patient safety"", ""brain ischemia"", ""subarachnoid hemorrhage -- therapy"", ""brain hemorrhage"", ""traumatic brain injury"", ""postoperative infection"", ""randomized controlled trial (topic)"", ""anemia"", ""erythrocyte"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""population"", ""infection -- complication"", ""brain blood flow"", ""subarachnoid hemorrhage -- drug therapy -- hypertensive factor"", ""leukocyte"", ""blood transfusion reaction -- complication"", ""hypertensive factor -- drug therapy"", ""hospital infection"", ""critically ill patient"", ""hypoxemia"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""clinical practice"", ""fever"", ""storage"", ""hypertensive factor -- drug therapy -- subarachnoid hemorrhage"", ""immune response"", ""patient"", ""critical illness -- therapy"", ""priority journal"", ""human"", ""disease transmission"", ""therapy effect"", ""immune deficiency -- complication"", ""lung edema"", ""intensive care"", ""therapy"", ""disease predisposition"", ""dyspnea"", ""brain"", ""disease association"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""infection risk"", ""length of stay"", ""mortality"", ""meta analysis (topic)"", ""subarachnoid hemorrhage -- drug therapy"", ""practice guideline""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13311-011-0094-5"", ""issn"": ""19337213"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street 3 West Gates, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States Monisha.Kumar@uphs.upenn.edu, Departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street 3 West Gates, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States, Kumar, M.

This study aimed to identify MM prognostic factors and to measure its impact on oncological outcomes. Methods: A post-hoc analysis of a prospective cohort of 734 patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM) from 2006 to 2015 was undertaken. Five hundred and two patients who had complete CRS and HIPEC for PM were included. Results: Major morbidity was identified in 31% (156/502) of CRS/HIPEC procedures, including 67 hemorrhagic complication (13.3%), 87 anastomotic leaks (17.4%), 121 reoperation (24.1%), and 65 pulmonary complication (12.9%). The multivariate predictors of MM were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (ASA 3 vs. 1-2, 0R 95%CI: 3.58 [1.54 - 8.34]), origin of PM colorectal adenocarcinoma vs. other, OR 95%CI: 1.62 [1.06 - 2.48]), type of HIPEC drug (oxaliplatin vs. other, OR 95%CI: 2.85 [1.28 - 6.32]), number of anastomosis (no vs. at least 1, HR 95%CI: 1.85 [1.19 - 2.88]), blood transfusion (OR 95%CI: 1.84 [1.05 - 3.23]) and length of surgery longer than the median value (OR 95%CI: 1.88 [1.22 - 2.91]). The in-hospital mortality rate for the entire cohort was 1.7% (9/502). Rate of adjuvant chemotherapy after CRS/HIPEC was comparable between the two groups (70.3% vs. 72.4%, p = 0.64). The median duration of follow-up was 18 months. The MM group had worst OS and DFS comparing non-MM (Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval at 3.48 [1.90 ; 6.35] and 1.91 [1.43 ; 2.57], respectively). Conclusions: Major morbidity after CRS/HIPEC for peritoneal metastasis is a source of significant reoperation and longer hospital and intensive care unit stay; with a decrease in overall survival and disease free survival even after complete CRS. Preoperative ASA score, number of anastomoses, colorectal origin of PM, HIPEC with oxaliplatin, blood transfusion and length of surgery are independent predictors of MM for CRS/HIPEC patients.",2017/06/20/,American Society of Clinical Oncology,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1923175942?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1923175942; 617435220"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""oxaliplatin"", ""61825-94-3"", ""Embase"", ""adjuvant chemotherapy"", ""peritoneum metastasis"", ""complication"", ""major clinical study"", ""follow up"", ""overall survival"", ""intensive care unit"", ""disease free survival"", ""female"", ""morbidity"", ""human"", ""hospital mortality"", ""blood transfusion"", ""drug therapy"", ""anesthesiologist"", ""cytoreductive surgery"", ""adenocarcinoma"", ""lung complication"", ""controlled study"", ""anastomosis leakage"", ""cancer epidemiology"", ""hazard ratio"", ""reoperation"", ""confidence interval"", ""post hoc analysis"", ""male"", ""surgery""], ""issn"": ""0732183X"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Hopital Lariboisiere AP-HP Service de Chirurgie Digestie et Cancérologie Paris France; Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France; Medical Oncology Department, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France; Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France , Hopital Lariboisiere AP-HP Service de Chirurgie Digestie et Cancérologie Paris France; Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France; Medical Oncology Department, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France; Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2017-07-25"", ""Date revised - 2017-07-25"", ""Last updated - 2017-07-26""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Clinical+Oncology&rft.atitle=Effect+of+postoperative+morbidity+on+survival+after+cytoreductive+surgery+%28CRS%29+with+heated+intraperitoneal+chemotherapy+%28HIPEC%29+for+peritoneal+metastasis+in+a+series+of+700+cases&rft.au=Eveno%2C+Clarisse&rft.aulast=Eveno&rft.aufirst=Clarisse&rft.date=2017-06-20&rft.volume=35&rft.issue=15&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Clinical+Oncology&rft.issn=0732183X&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""2017 Jun 20""}"

It was the aim of the present study to explore if surgical patients with severe sepsis might have a treatment benefit from an activity-guided AT-III therapy. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using an intensive care unit (ICU) database. To examine the effect of AT-III on outcome and on red cell transfusion rate, multivariate generalized additive models (GAMs), Cox-type additive hazard regression models, and propensity score adjustments were used. Five hundred forty-five postoperative surgical patients requiring ICU therapy because of severe sepsis were analyzed. Antithrombin III was given to those patients believed to be at a high risk of dying. Antithrombin III therapy was guided by the individual AT-III activity and aimed at the maintenance of an activity of at least 100%. Antithrombin III supplementation was discontinued after the plasma AT-III activity had been persistently normal without simultaneous AT-III infusion. We found that patients receiving additional AT-III (n = 230) were sicker than those on standard therapy (n = 315; admission Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, 19.8 +/- 7.3 vs. 17.9 +/- 7.1 [mean +/- SD]; P < 0.005). Correspondingly, 28-day mortality was higher in patients who had an additional AT-III therapy than in those on standard therapy (46.3% vs. 36.9%; P < 0.03), as was the number of red cell units transfused during ICU stay (21.5 +/- 26.7 vs. 9.3 +/- 12.1; P < 0.001). At multivariate analysis, there was no significant effect of AT-III therapy on 28-day mortality (GAM: odds ratio, 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.651 - 1.573; P = 0.957) and 90-day survival time (Cox-type additive hazard regression: hazard ratio, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.779 - 1.387; P = 0.794). However, AT-III therapy was associated with a significantly higher frequency of red cell unit transfusion (GAM/zero-inflated Poisson: estimate, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15 - 139; P < 0.001).

This study examines these representations among practitioners and sheds light on the clinical and nonclinical factors that guide blood transfusion (BT) decision-making in Quebec, Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With a qualitative exploratory study design, data were collected in the pediatric intensive care unit and the hematology-oncology unit of Sainte-Justine Hospital in 2009. A total of fifteen 1-hour-long semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians. RESULTS: Physicians affirm that the symbolic connotations of blood found in the lay population do not influence their transfusion decisions. However, there are other ""social"" and ""cultural' aspects that influence these practices. Also, BT strategies remain diverse across units. Practitioners perceive these situations as resulting from insufficient training and by the existence of an ""oral tradition"" and a professional culture that are resistant to change. CONCLUSION: BT practices differ within and across units. Many dimensions intervene in the decision to transfuse, from individual clinical appreciation and local unit ""culture"" to formal and ad hoc training. Consistent change in BT can only occur with the implementation of norms and guidelines that are endorsed by key influential figures. An extensive multicentered study is necessary to better understand how social and cultural factors affect BT practices.

072ab96b-b628-46f4-8308-f8c482eac6de,High incidence of thrombotic cerebral lesions in adult patients with beta-thalassemia major,"['Pazgal, I.', 'Inbar, E.', 'Cohen, M.', 'Shpilberg, O.', 'Raanani, P.', 'Rachmilewitz, E.', 'Stark, P.']",Thrombosis Research,133,,S116,"Background: The prolonged survival of b-thalassemia major (TM) patients due to improved treatment, results in complications that have not been recognized before, including thromboembolic complications, such as cerebral thrombotic events. Asymptomatic silent cerebral infarctions (SCI), at incidence of 27-60%, have been demonstrated by MRI in patients with b-thalassemia intermedia (TI) (Musallam et al. Thromb Res 130: 695, 2012), but less data is available for TM. In this study, we determined the incidence of SCI in transfusion-dependent TM patients. Methods: The study included 18 patients with transfusiondependent TM, 10 males and 8 females, 21-42 years old. Sixteen patients were Spx. After obtaining an informed consent, brain MRI was performed prior to receiving blood transfusion, using 3T Ingenia (Philips) system in SET1 TSET2 diffusion SWI (5mm slice) and 3DFLAIR (1.1mm slice). Results: Average platelet count in Spx patients was 565k/ml (range 330-784) and in 2 unspx-242k/ml (164, 320). Average ferritin level was 1707 ng/ml (range 295-7431). Twelve patients had focal bright lesions in the cerebral white matter. Ten spx patients had a mean of 16 lesions (range 1-73), while 2 unspx had 1 and 53 lesions. Most of the lesions were in frontal lobes and bilateral, maximal diameter up to 7mm. All lesions were negative in diffusion with no susceptibility artifacts. The MRI findings did not correlate with the laboratory parameters, except for ferritin which was higher (1918 ng/ml) in patients with SCI lesions vs. those without lesions (1215 ng/ml). Moreover, 5 of the 9 patients with ferritin 1000 ng/ml had a mean of 21.1 lesions. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a 66% incidence of asymptomatic SCI in TM patients which were similar in size and location to those observed in TI. These findings suggest that the increased number of activated platelets in Spx patients with TI as well as in patients with TM, rather than the high number of pathological circulating RBC, is a factor in the etiology of SCI. In addition, iron overload, documented by high ferritin levels, may also play a role in the etiology of hypercoagulability in thalassemia. Based on the results, we recommend that, in addition to iron chelation, low dose aspirin should be given routinely to transfused TM patients.",2014/05//,Elsevier Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1545366230?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1545366230; 71522103"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""thalassemia major"", ""ferritin"", ""diffusion"", ""thromboembolism"", ""nuclear magnetic resonance imaging"", ""transfusion"", ""artifact"", ""thrombocyte activation"", ""thrombocyte count"", ""white matter"", ""thrombosis"", ""informed consent"", ""patient"", ""nuclear magnetic resonance scanner"", ""female"", ""human"", ""blood transfusion"", ""iron overload"", ""brain infarction"", ""thalassemia"", ""hypercoagulability"", ""survival"", ""low drug dose"", ""brain damage"", ""brain"", ""thalassemia intermedia"", ""acetylsalicylic acid"", ""etiology"", ""erythrocyte"", ""beta thalassemia"", ""laboratory"", ""frontal lobe"", ""iron chelation"", ""adult"", ""parameters"", ""male""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0049-3848(14)50366-0"", ""issn"": ""00493848"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel , Wolfson Hospital, Clinical Center 1, Holon, Israel , Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel, Pazgal, I., Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 23rd Biennial International Congress on Thrombosis - MLTD Congress 2014"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2014-07-14"", ""Date revised - 2014-07-16"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Thrombosis+Research&rft.atitle=High+incidence+of+thrombotic+cerebral+lesions+in+adult+patients+with+beta-thalassemia+major&rft.au=Pazgal%2C+I.&rft.aulast=Pazgal&rft.aufirst=I.&rft.date=2014-05-01&rft.volume=133&rft.issue=&rft.spage=S116&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Thrombosis+Research&rft.issn=00493848&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2FS0049-3848%2814%2950366-0"", ""date"": ""May 2014""}"

Results: In 53/71(75 % ) laser-treated TTTS cases, at least one twin was liveborn and in 42/71(59 % ) cases at least one twin survived infancy. Fetal survival did not differ between donors [41/71(58 % )] and recipients [46/71(65 % ), P = 0.36]. Among liveborns, infant survival was 29/41(71 % ) in donors and 36/46(78 % ) in recipients (P = 0.12). Infant survival did not correlate to maternal characteristics (age, BMI, smoking or parity), gestational age at treatment or severity of TTTS (Quintero stage). No TTTS infant born before 25 weeks of gestation survived the first week. Among the 87 infant survivors, 26 (30%) had an Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, 47 (54%) developed respiratory distress syndrome, 10 (11 % ) showed signs of severe brain damage, nine (10 % ) renal failure, eight (9 % ) bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and five (6 % ) infants developed retinopathy of prematurity .≥ stage 3. There was no significant difference in neonatal morbidity between recipients and donors.

Platelet (PLT) transfusions are usually administered to neonates with thrombocytopenia at higher thresholds than those used for older children or adults, although there is a paucity of evidence to guide these decisions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we used a Web-based survey to investigate the PLT transfusion thresholds used in Level 1 NICUs (equivalent to Level 3 in the US) in three European countries (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland [AUT/GER/SUI]). This survey was identical to the one that was previously sent to US neonatologists, thus allowing for a direct comparison of their responses to 11 case-based scenarios. RESULTS: In nine of the scenarios, AUT/GER/SUI neonatologists selected substantially lower PLT transfusion thresholds than US neonatologists (p < 0.0001). Transfusion thresholds were more similar when treating neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and before invasive procedures. The clinical impact of these differences was estimated by extrapolating the AUT/GER/SUI versus the US answers to a cohort of neonates with a birth weight below 1000 g. This suggested that, in AUT/GER/SUI, these neonates would receive 167 PLT transfusions per 1000 infants, compared to 299 PLT transfusions in the United States.

However, blood transfusion practices have also been shown to cause significant adverse outcomes, which may negate the therapeutic effect of the intervention. To address the varying policies regarding the administration of blood products, healthcare professionals have adopted a consensus-based approach. The absence of a standard protocol has resulted in conflicting outcomes in previous clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of blood transfusion practices in preterm infants by analyzing past clinical research and identifying the current trends that have emerged as a result of recent trials. RESULTS: Recent trials have demonstrated comparable trends in mortality rates and other primary outcomes, including retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and brain injury, following transfusion of blood products in both groups. Nevertheless, employing restrictive thresholds rather than adopting a liberal approach can reduce these outcomes. CONCLUSION: The current literature does not provide clear support for either technique as opposing and contradictory results are evident. However, there is a slight inclination toward the restrictive transfusion threshold due to recent trials, which warrants further in-depth investigation into this issue.",2024,England,https://doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000001751,"{""pmid"": 38463073, ""electronic_issn"": ""2049-0801"", ""print_issn"": ""2049-0801"", ""linking_issn"": ""2049-0801"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101616869"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""keywords"": [""guidelines"", ""neonatal physiology"", ""preterm infants"", ""thresholds"", ""transfusion practices""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2024 Mar"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2023-09-28"", ""accepted"": ""2024-01-12"", ""published"": ""2024-03-11"", ""electronic"": ""2024-01-23""}}"

Immunomodulatory effects have been ascribed to blood transfusion. This retrospective cohort study investigates the association between the development of nosocomial bacterial infection and transfusion of leukodepleted red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets (PLTs) in survivors of the initial phase of sepsis. Patients diagnosed with sepsis after admission to the intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital were included. Of 134 patients with sepsis, 67 received a blood transfusion (50%). A secondary infection developed in 19 patients (14%). A multiple logistic regression model revealed that the use of immunosuppressive medication with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.31), but not Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, malignancy, HIV infection, alcohol abuse, or diabetes mellitus, was a risk factor for nosocomial infection. In an adjusted model, the amount of transfused RBCs was associated with secondary infection with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01-1.37). Storage time of RBCs was a relevant confounder of the effect of the amount of RBCs on infection, with an adjusted OR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04-1.51), P = 0.02. Also, the amount of transfused PLTs was associated with secondary infection, with an OR of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.05-1.78). In conclusion, transfusion of RBCs and PLTs is associated with the onset of secondary bacterial infection in sepsis patients. Storage time of RBCs influences this increased risk. These findings suggest that immunomodulatory effects of blood transfusion contribute to adverse outcome in the convalescent phase of sepsis.",2011,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182086094,"{""pmid"": 21192282, ""electronic_issn"": ""1540-0514"", ""linking_issn"": ""1073-2322"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9421564"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Bacterial Infections"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Platelet Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Sepsis"", ""qualifier"": ""microbiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Transfusion Reaction"", ""major"": true}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2011 Apr"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2010-12-31""}}"

49206db5-85c5-46b9-9ff4-33341219aa3e,A Fatal Case of Septic Shock Secondary to Acinetobacter Bacteremia Acquired from a Platelet Transfusion,"['Nevala-Plagemann, C.', 'Powers, P.', 'Mir-Kasimov, M.', 'Rose, R.']",Case Reports in Medicine,2019,,,"Background. Transfusion of blood products is a frequent and often necessary lifesaving intervention. While changes to blood bank practices over the past several decades have reduced the infectious complications associated with transfusions, risks still exist. Septic transfusion reactions caused by bacterial contamination of blood products, especially platelets, still occur relatively frequently. Unfortunately, clinical recognition of septic transfusion reactions is difficult due to significant symptom, exam, and laboratory abnormality overlap between different types of transfusion reactions, as well as other conditions. Novel methods have been developed to detect blood product contamination but have yet to be widely implemented in the United States. Case Report. A 67-year-old male with chronic thrombocytopenia was transfused with platelets prior to a planned procedure. Shortly afterwards, he developed fever and hypotension. He was transferred to the intensive care unit where he was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient went on to develop progressively worsening shock and profound disseminated intravascular coagulation. Blood cultures from the patient and the transfused platelets grew an Acinetobacter species. Despite aggressive resuscitative efforts and appropriate antibiotics, the patient died approximately 48 hours following the transfusion reaction. Conclusion. We report a fatal case of septic shock associated with Acinetobacter bacteremia caused by platelet transfusion. Our review of the literature revealed only one other documented platelet transfusion associated fatality caused by Acinetobacter species.

Small-volume tubes have the same cost, dimensions, and blood-draw techniques as standard-volume tubes, and are compatible with laboratory equipment; however, they are not commonly used. We sought to assess the feasibility of a stepped-wedge cluster trial to determine whether small-volume tubes reduce transfusion compared with standard-volume tubes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective mixed-methods pilot study (before-after design) in one ICU with a six-week control period (standard-volume tubes) and a six-week intervention period (small-volume tubes). All patients admitted to the ICU were included. Feasibility was assessed as successful switch to small-volume tubes; adherence to tube size; sufficient volume for testing; user acceptance; barriers and facilitators to implementation; and 95% transfusion collection. We explored end-user acceptability using focus groups. Results: One hundred and sixty-five patients were included in the standard-volume and 204 in the small-volume periods. Transition to small-volume tubes was successful. Random audits showed 100% compliance. The proportion of samples with inadequate volume for testing was the same for both groups (both, 0.2%). Based on ten focus groups, small-volume tubes were acceptable with no barriers identified. Transfusion data collection was 100%. Median [interquartile range] estimated blood loss due to laboratory testing per patient per day in ICU was 11 [8–17] mL with standard-volume and 6 [4–8] mL with small-volume tubes. Conclusion: Small-volume tubes can be implemented with acceptability to end-users and without barriers. They did not result in an increased frequency of inadequate samples. These results inform a trial to determine whether small-volume tubes reduce transfusion.

However, the underlying pathophysiology and impact of prolonged exposure of the developing infant to low levels of hemoglobin remains unclear. Phlebotomy losses exacerbate the gradual decline of hemoglobin levels which is insidious in presentation, often without any clinical signs. Progressive anemia in preterm infants is associated with poor weight gain, inability to take oral feeds, tachycardia and exacerbation of apneic, and bradycardic events. There remains a lack of consensus on treatment thresholds for RBC transfusion which vary considerably. This review elaborates on the current state of the problem, its implication for the premature infant including association with subphysiologic cerebral tissue oxygenation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients who received minimal invasive MVP between 2007 January and 2020 January at our department. The basic characteristics, echocardiography, surgical data, postoperative adverse events and hospital cost of the patients were collected. The primary outcomes of this study were direct hospital cost and 30-day outcomes, including the operative time, complications, and length of hospital stay. Results: A total of 234 patients received minimally invasive MVP by using robotic (n=121) and thoracoscopic (n=113) technique respectively. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.9% (n=2), with no significant difference between two groups. The cardiopulmonary bypass time and aorta clamping time in thoracoscopic group were longer than that in robotic group (153.2±25.6 vs. 123.8±34.9 min and 111.8±23.0 vs. 84.9±24.3 min, P<0.001).

Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay and long-term cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVES. The aim of current study is to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of delirium in critically ill patients in surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS. We performed a retrospective study of development of delirium from November 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013. A total of 325 patients admitted to SICU for more than 24 h were enrolled. Patients were evaluated for development of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU Patients (CAM-ICU). We evaluated risk factors for the development of delirium with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS. Of the 325 patients, delirium was developed in 89 (27.4 %) patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (adjusted OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.02-1.07), intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (adjusted OR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.81-0.98), APACHE II score (adjusted OR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.05-1.15), stroke (adjusted OR 3.05, 95 % CI 1.37-6.79), intraoperative administration of midazolam (adjusted OR 3.97, 95 % CI 1.68- 9.40) were independent risk factors of delirium.

We proposed to determine if patients expected to receive blood products have a decrease in PLT function higher than expected based on the reduction in PLT count, and if the reduction in function could be associated with the donor plasma/supernatant received. Methods PLT count and function were measured on admission to the emergency department and intensive care unit in severely injured patients expected to receive a transfusion. PLT function was measured by Multiplate aggregometry in response to five agonists. Function was corrected for alterations in count. In vitro studies were conducted in the blood of normal subjects to assess the effect of dilutions with AB donor plasma on PLT function. Results Forty-six patients were enrolled, with 87% requiring a transfusion. Median Injury Severity Score was 23 (13, 29) and mortality 15%. PLT count and function were decreased from emergency department to intensive care unit admission by 25% and 58%, respectively. Decreases in function persisted after adjustment for count. Patients requiring large volumes of blood products had reductions in function that were disproportionately greater. Reductions in PLT function were greatest after transfusion of PLTs. In in vitro studies with a 30% dilution by autologous plasma caused a relational reduction in function, whereas allogenic plasma resulted in greater decreases that were highly variable between donors. Conclusions Within hours of injury a decrease in both PLT count and function occurs, that is aggravated with the administration of blood products, with transfusion of PLTs showing the greatest effect.

We analyzed transfusions and compared outcomes among NICUs. STUDY DESIGN: In a 6-site prospective study, we abstracted all newborns weighing < 1500 g (total = 825) born between October 1994 and September 1995. Transfusion frequency and volume and phlebotomy number were analyzed by site and adjusted for birth weight and illness severity. We compared rates of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, growth, and length of stay between the high and low transfuser NICUs. RESULTS: Sites differed significantly in mean birth weight, illness severity, number of transfusions, pretransfusion hematocrit, blood draws, and donor number. Multivariate adjustment for these risks showed that the highest transfusing NICU transfused an additional 24 cc/kg per baby during the first 14 days and 47 cc/kg per baby after 15 days, relative to the lowest transfusing NICU. The presence of arterial catheters increased the frequency of blood transfusions. The rates of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were not higher in the 2 lowest transfusing NICUs, nor were there differences in 28-day weight gain or length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Major differences in transfusion practices for very low birth weight infants exist among NICUs.

Data remain limited in terms of whether differences in gestational age of patients who attempt TOLAC affect maternal morbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the association between gestational age and maternal adverse outcomes in women undergoing trial of labor after cesarean. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used birth data from the U.S. National Vital Statistics from 2014 to 2018. Women with liveborn singleton gestation who underwent TOLAC at 23-41 weeks' gestation were included in the analytic population. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal adverse outcomes: admission to the Intensive Care Unit, blood transfusion, uterine rupture, or unplanned hysterectomy. Secondary outcomes were individual measures within the primary composite outcome. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent TOLAC at term (37-41 weeks gestational age) and those who underwent TOLAC at preterm (23-36 weeks gestational age). Multivariable analyses were adjusted for demographic and obstetric differences between the two groups. RESULTS: 455,284 patients met inclusion criteria for the study; 39,589 (8.7%) were at a preterm gestational age (GA) and 415,695 (91.3%) were at a term GA. The overall composite maternal adverse outcome was significantly higher for patients undergoing TOLAC at preterm GA (12.0 per 1000 live births) compared to term GA (8.0 per 1000 live births; aRR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.29-1.56). Among individual conditions within the primary composite outcome, preterm gestational age was associated with increased risk of admission to the Intensive Care Unit, blood transfusion, and unplanned hysterectomy.

However, these models only partly mimic the clinical situation, because of the use of blood transfusion and arterial inflow via the tail artery. Thus a model using arterial inflow in the aorta and a miniaturized CPB circuit without need of transfusion was validated by examining intra-procedure characteristics, mortality and the effects of CPB on biomarkers of inflammation and cerebral injury during 5. days follow-up. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n=95) were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5%) and fentanyl/midazolam during CPB. Animals were assigned to Control (n=6), Sham (n=40) or normothermic CPB (n=49) groups. Both Sham and CPB were cannulated in the aorta via the left carotid artery and in the right common jugular vein for access into the right heart. Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was instituted for 60min only in CPB at a flow rate of 120mLkg-1min-1 employing a CPB circuit of 15ml primed with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 60mgml-1 solution. Rats were sacrificed at either 1h or 1, 2 or 5days after Sham or weaning from CPB. Plasma IL-6 and s100Beta levels were measured and blood cell counts were performed. Results: Mortality in CPB animals (3 out of 49) and Sham (4 out of 40) did not differ (chi-square = 0.46, dF = 1, P > 0.5). Compared to baseline (1.87 ± 0.46 * 10^9 cells/L), Sham procedure (cannulation and anesthesia) significantly increased blood neutrophil count at the end of the period matching ECC (6.34 ± 2.36 * 10^9 cells/L, P < 0.05). CPB induced neutrophilia which persisted during 24. h recovery. Also, CPB caused a rapid and prominent increase in plasma IL-6 from the first hour of the postoperative period (~ 1200 pg/ml) with continuation (50-90. pg/ml) up to 5th day of recovery. S100Beta levels were above detection level only in 3 out of 42 samples from CPB animals. Discussion: Our rat model of CPB without homologous blood transfusion produces a reproducible and reliable systemic inflammatory response, with low mortality rates on long term follow up. The model more closely mimics the human situation in respect to arterial inflow site and avoidance of blood transfusion. Thus, our CPB model is suitable to study its influence on systemic inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, microcirculation and vascular dysfunction in vivo, and to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2013/03//,"Elsevier Inc., 360 Park Avenue South, NY 10010",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1326654284?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1326654284; 52422075"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Cardiopulmonary bypass"", ""Extracorporeal circulation"", ""IL-6"", ""Model"", ""S100B"", ""Systemic inflammatory response"", ""fentanyl"", ""437-38-7"", ""hetastarch"", ""9005-27-0"", ""isoflurane"", ""26675-46-7"", ""midazolam"", ""59467-70-8"", ""protein S100B"", ""357701-89-4"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""5:General Pathology and Pathological Anatomy"", ""25:Hematology"", ""extracorporeal circulation"", ""postoperative period"", ""transfusion"", ""artery catheterization"", ""protein blood level"", ""flow rate"", ""blood cell count"", ""Wistar rat"", ""jugular vein"", ""cardiopulmonary bypass"", ""model"", ""body temperature"", ""animal model"", ""cannulation"", ""rat"", ""animal cell"", ""heart"", ""animal experiment"", ""article"", ""neutrophil count"", ""tail artery"", ""interleukin 6 -- endogenous compound"", ""nonhuman"", ""male"", ""neutrophilia"", ""artery blood flow"", ""sham procedure"", ""reliability"", ""reperfusion injury"", ""anesthesia"", ""follow up"", ""brain injury"", ""inflammation"", ""long term survival"", ""procedures"", ""human"", ""blood transfusion"", ""reproducibility"", ""in vivo study"", ""blood"", ""microcirculation"", ""weaning"", ""convalescence"", ""biological marker"", ""controlled study"", ""vascular disease"", ""mortality"", ""aorta"", ""plasma"", ""carotid artery"", ""protein S100B -- endogenous compound""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2013.01.002"", ""issn"": ""10568719"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Dept. of Anesthesiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands i.v.samarska@umcg.nl m.c.houwertjes@umcg.nl h.e.mungroop@umcg.nl m.m.r.f.struys@umcg.nl a.r.absalom@umcg.nl a.h.epema@umcg.nl, Dept. of Clinical Pharmacology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands r.h.henning@umcg.nl j.h.buikema@umcg.nl, Depts. of Anesthesiology and Clinical Pharmacology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands h.r.bouma@umcg.nl, Dept. of Anesthesiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Netherlands, Samarska, I.V., Dept. of Anesthesiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 196, 9700AD Groningen, Netherlands"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2013-04-12"", ""Date revised - 2013-08-25"", ""Number of references - 33"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - JPTME""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Pharmacological+and+Toxicological+Methods&rft.atitle=Troubleshooting+the+rat+model+of+cardiopulmonary+bypass%3A+Effects+of+avoiding+blood+transfusion+on+long-term+survival%2C+inflammation+and+organ+damage&rft.au=Samarska%2C+Iryna+V.&rft.aulast=Samarska&rft.aufirst=Iryna&rft.date=2013-03-01&rft.volume=67&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=82&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Pharmacological+and+Toxicological+Methods&rft.issn=10568719&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.vascn.2013.01.002"", ""date"": ""Mar 2013""}"

In a retrospective study, a possible correlation between the body temperature at the time of admission to the emergency room and subsequent in-hospital transfusion requirements and the in-hospital mortality rate was explored. Setting: This is a retrospective single-centre study at a primary care hospital in Germany. Participants: 15 895 patients were included in this study. Patients were classified by admission temperature and transfusion rate. Excluded were ambulant patients and patients with missing data. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome values were length of stay (LOS) in days, in-hospital mortality, the transferred amount of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary influencing variables were the patient's age and the Glasgow Coma Scale. Results: In 22.85% of the patients, hypothermia was documented. Hypothermic patients died earlier in the course of their hospital stay than non-hypothermic patients (p<0.001). The administration of 1-3 PRBC increased the LOS significantly (p<0.001) and transfused patients had an increased risk of death (p<0.001). Prehospital hypothermia could be an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted OR 8.521; p=0.001) and increases the relative risk for transfusion by factor 2.0 (OR 2.007; p=0.002).

0adf360e-d2d6-414a-bb12-5cc9af641e22,Red blood cell transfusion practices in two surgical intensive care units: A mixed methods assessment of barriers to evidence-based practice,"['Murphy, David J.', 'Pronovost, Peter J.', 'Lehmann, Christoph U.', 'Gurses, Ayse P.', 'Whitman, Glenn J.R.', 'Needham, Dale M.', 'Berenholtz, Sean M.']",Transfusion,54,1,2658-2667,"Background Despite evidence supporting restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds and the associated clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice has been slow to change in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our aim was to identify barriers to conservative transfusion practice adherence.Study Design and Methods A mixed-methods study involving observation of prescriber (i.e., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) and bedside nurse daily bedside rounds, provider survey, and medical record abstraction was conducted in one cardiac surgical ICU (CSICU) and one surgical ICU (SICU) in an academic hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.Results Of 52 patient encounters observed during bedside rounds, 38 (73%) involved patients without evidence of active bleeding or cardiac ischemia. Surveys were completed by 52 (93%) of the 56 providers participating in rounds. Prescribers in the CSICU and SICU (87 and 90%, respectively) indicated the ideal pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb) to be not more than 7 g/dL in nonbleeding and/or nonischemic patients compared to a minority of nurses (8% [p = 0.002] and 42% [p = 0.015], respectively). Prescribers and nurses in both ICUs overestimated the typical pretransfusion Hb in their units (CSICU, p < 0.001; SICU, p = 0.019). During rounds, providers infrequently explicitly discussed Hb monitoring or transfusion thresholds (33%) despite most (60%) reporting significant variation in transfusion thresholds between individual prescribers.Conclusions Our study identified several provider and system barriers to evidence-based transfusion practices including knowledge differences, overly optimistic estimates of current practice, and heterogeneous transfusion practice in each ICU.

To determine associated feto-maternal outcomes and economic costs for the institution. Methods: Observational study in a tertiary care Italian public hospital during a 10-year period. To identify severe obstetric complications, the following management-based criteria were adopted: need for intensive care unit admission, blood transfusion ≥5 units, emergency peripartum hysterectomy/laparotomy and arterial embolization. Impact of severe obstetric complications on facility resources was estimated considering length of hospital stay, need for additional surgery and transfusion. Results: A total of 151 cases were identified, most frequent obstetric morbidities being major obstetric hemorrhage (50.3%) and hypertensive disorders (19.2%). Pre-term birth, caesarean section and sub-saharan African origin were factors significantly associated with severe morbidity. Maternal mortality and maternal mortality to morbidity ratios were 17 per 100,000 live births and 3:151, respectively. Stillbirth rate was 4.4%. Massive use of blood products and prolonged admissions concurred to increase hospital expenditures. Conclusion: Institutional severe maternal morbidities may be effectively monitored by implementing a surveillance program and selecting a combination of management-based criteria which define the extremely morbid cases.

The goals of this analysis were: 1) To describe blood utilization according to clinical diagnoses and patient characteristics at a large public hospital, Hospital das Clinicas (HC), a tertiary teaching hospital and trauma center in Sao Paulo; 2) To determine the survival status of blood recipients. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all inpatients in 2004. Data came from three sources that were merged together: HC electronic admission files, blood issue files from the blood bank, and the national death registry. The first two files were used to describe patient characteristics during admission. The third fi le was used to determine survival status of recipients after one year. Analyses comparing transfused and non-transfused patients were conducted. Results: During 2004, 30,779 patients were admitted to HC, with 3,820 (12.4%) transfused. These patients received 10,479 transfusions, consisting of 39,561 components, 16,748 (42%) red cells, 15,828 (40%) platelets and 6,190 (16%) plasma. The median number of components transfused was 3 (range 1-656) per patient admission. More females (55%) were admitted, but more males (15% vs. 10.5%) were transfused. Admission ward varied by age and older aged patients were more likely to be transfused. Mortality during hospitalization was dramatically different between non-transfused and transfused patients (5% vs. 27%). Patterns for the primary diagnoses were different between transfused and non-transfused patients. Restricted to transfused patients, the table provides survival after 24 hours, at discharge, and 1 year post transfusion. Survival varied by ward with the lowest survival in intensive care unit patients, but was not markedly different between the sexes. After 1 year, only 56% of transfusion recipients were alive. Conclusion: Transfusion and ward are markers of underlying medical conditions and the probability of survival. Platelet transfusions are common and likely reflect the types of patients treated at HC. The findings for HC may not be applicable to other hospitals. Nonetheless, the data can help in developing health policy analyses and represents the first comprehensive blood utilization study in Brazil.",2010/09//,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013160156?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013160156; 70288401"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""hospital admission"", ""death"", ""transfusion"", ""health care policy"", ""ward"", ""public hospital"", ""patient"", ""thrombocyte transfusion"", ""Brazil"", ""cross-sectional study"", ""intensive care unit"", ""hospital"", ""hospital patient"", ""female"", ""blood transfusion"", ""emergency health service"", ""hospitalization"", ""blood bank"", ""teaching hospital"", ""survival"", ""aged"", ""diagnosis"", ""blood"", ""erythrocyte"", ""thrombocyte"", ""marker"", ""recipient"", ""mortality"", ""plasma"", ""male"", ""register""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02833-1.x"", ""issn"": ""00411132"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, United States tgoncalez@bloodsystems.org, Fundacao Pro Sangue, Sao Paulo, Brazil , Westat, Rockville, MD, United States , University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil , University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, Fundacao Pro Sangue, Sao Paulo, Brazil , Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, United States, Laboratory Medicine, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States , Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, United States, Goncalez, T.T., Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - AABB Annual Meeting and CTTXPO"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2010-10-30"", ""Date revised - 2010-11-02"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Transfusion&rft.atitle=Blood+transfusion+in+S%C3%A3o+Paulo%2C+Brazil%3A+An+analysis+of+blood+utilization+and+recipient+survivorship+at+hospital+das+clinicas&rft.au=Goncalez%2C+T.T.&rft.aulast=Goncalez&rft.aufirst=T.T.&rft.date=2010-09-01&rft.volume=50&rft.issue=&rft.spage=186A&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion&rft.issn=00411132&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fj.1537-2995.2010.02833-1.x"", ""date"": ""Sep 2010""}"

We assessed the number of hospitalised patients who were transfused, the number and type of blood components donated and the number and type of blood components transfused in different care settings. RESULTS: Blood donations were lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a significant reduction in red blood cells (RBC) transfused (-29% in 2020 vs 2019) and fewer transfusions in 2020 in the Internal Medicine departments (-67% and -44% in Centres 1 and 2, respectively) and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) (-53% and -54% in Centres 1 and 2, respectively).

Methods: All children before the surgery were carefully examined. The obligatory laboratory tests are full blood count and coagulation system examination (APTT, SPA, INR). General anaesthesia with Propof ol, Sevof lurane, Fentanyl, Esmeron was done. Usual monitoring including intra-arterial blood pressure or NICO were used. Results: Our experience using this device is 11 children from 11 to 17 years old. We have used this device during scoliosis correction surgery and during the first six hours postoperatively in ICU. The haemoglobin (HGB) of all patients before operation was from 112 to 165 g/l. The surgery lasted from 6 to 9 hours. Blood loss was from 450 to 2200 ml during surgery and including the first 6 postoperative hours. This blood was collected, washed, concentrated and reinfused, from 130 to 870 ml autollogic red blood cells. HGB of patients were from 82 to 105 g/l on the second day. Only two patients received 1 unit of allogenic blood transfusion because the Hb value felt down on the third postoperative day. All patients were discharged approximately on 9th day after operation. Conclusions. Perioperative salvage and return of red blood cells with Ortho-PAT device effectively reduces the requirements of allogenic blood transfusion in children scoliosis surgery.

Patients with nonresponsive platelets had similar in-hospital mortality (3 [3.0%] vs. 6 [6.3%], p = 0.324), tICH progression (26 [27.1%] vs. 24 [26.1%], p = 0.877), intensive care unit admission rates (34 [34.3%] vs. 38 [40.0%), p = 0.415), and length of stay (3 [interquartile range, 2-8] vs. 3.2 [interquartile range, 2-7], p = 0.818) to those with responsive platelets. Platelet transfusion did not improve platelet response or patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: Rapid platelet function testing detects a highly prevalent poor platelet response among patients with tICH, irrespective of antiplatelet medication use. VerifyNow correlated fairly with whole blood aggregometry among patients with tICH and platelet responsiveness detectable by these tests did not correlate with clinical outcomes. In addition, our results suggest that platelet transfusion may not improve clinical outcomes in patients with tICH.

The risk of death is related directly to the peak temperature, duration of exposure and acclimatisation period. This case report illustrates the management of multiple casualties of heat stroke in the emergency department and their outcomes. Clinical feature: Nine policemen arrived in the emergency department in semiconscious state after being retrieved from a group of policemen who were loaded into a bus without proper ventilation during a selection program. All of them presented with hyperpyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia and altered sensorium. Treatment: Immediate evaporative cooling with support of organ-system dysfunction was commenced. Six patients were intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. One patient was monitored in high dependency ward while the other two were admitted to the general medical ward. Outcome: All patients were extubated within 48 hours. None of them had residual neurological dysfunction. One patient developed coagulopathy which required blood product transfusion.

d637d7b7-3f2a-4c6f-8057-d7104582c976,Evaluation of the usefulness of erythrocyte suspensions obtained from placental blood with centrifugation and hollow fiber filtration methods for the autologous transfusion of neonates,"['Turhan, A.', 'Anik, A.', 'Degirmenci, A.', 'Cicekdag, I.', 'Uluer, Biceroglu S', 'Sertöz, R.', 'Aydinok, Y.']",Vox Sanguinis,101,,62,"Background: Almost all premature infants admitting to neonatal intensive care units need blood transfusions in the first weeks of their lives. Collection of placental blood as a source of autologous transfusion has been suggested as a good alternative to allogeneic transfusions in areas where donor resources are restricted or transfusion transmitted infections are common health problem. Aim: The safety and quality of packed red cells obtained from placental blood of premature and mature neonates and adult voluntary blood donors by centrifuge and hollow fiber filter system were evaluated. Method: Placental blood of 29 infants born in Medical Faculty of Ege University and the venous blood collected from 14 adult blood donors were covered in this study. The whole blood obtained according to randomization order was divided into two groups and separated into their components through conventional centrifuge and hollow fiber filtration methods. Of the packed red cells (PRCs) obtained, the product specifications (weight, volume) and the quality (hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase, free plasma hemoglobin, osmotic fragility, blood gas and bacteriological cultures) at 0 and 35 days, were investigated and validation of both methods for autologous transfusion were compared. Results: No significant difference was detected between the groups using fiber filter or centrifuge methods for erythrocyte suspension in terms of birth week, birth weight, placenta weight and the amount of collected cord blood (59.9 ± 5 mL and 59.1 ± 4.1 respectively, t test, P = 0.886 mL). However mean erythrocyte suspension volumes were significantly different (29.9 ± 1.9 and 45.9 ± 2.4 respectively, P < 0.001). The hematocrit (%) and unit-hemoglobin contents (g/U) of the erythrocyte suspensions obtained from placental blood through both methods have been found significantly lower than PRCs obtained from adult blood (t test, P < 0.001). The basal hemolysis of the PRCs obtained from placental blood has been found similar to that obtained from adult blood. However at the 35th day of storage period the percentage of hemolysis slightly exceeded the quality standards and indicated that neonatal erythrocytes are more susceptible to hemolysis and the storage periods should be shorter. PRCs obtained from adult blood through fiber filtering system possess effective product features as much as those obtained through centrifuge method. No bacterial growth was detected in cultures of erythrocyte suspensions obtained from cord and adult blood by both methods. Summary/conclusion: It was determined that the PRCs obtained from placental bloods by the two methods were not effective as the ones obtained from adult bloods as far as the product quality concerned. Despite pre-reduced amount of SAG-M in red cell bags of both hollow fiber and multi-pack systems, lower hemoglobin contents of PRCs obtained from placental blood were the consequence of decreased volume PRC: anticoagulant ratio. These PRCs with poor hemoglobin content were also not enough to meet all transfusion needs of neonates as autologous blood. Although, placental blood was achieved to collect without bacterial contamination, techniques and standards for collection, processing and preserving the placental blood still needed to be developed in clinical use.",2011/07//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013342872?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013342872; 70427892"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""osmotic fragility"", ""infection"", ""prematurity"", ""university"", ""venous blood"", ""Student t test"", ""hematocrit"", ""lactate potassium"", ""transfusion"", ""storage"", ""infant"", ""hemoglobin"", ""hemolysis"", ""donor"", ""randomization"", ""blood donor"", ""safety"", ""newborn intensive care"", ""umbilical cord blood"", ""intensive care unit"", ""suspension"", ""birth weight"", ""blood transfusion"", ""fiber"", ""Europe"", ""lactate dehydrogenase"", ""weight"", ""health"", ""leukocyte count"", ""newborn"", ""blood"", ""bacterial growth"", ""medical school"", ""erythrocyte concentrate"", ""erythrocyte"", ""centrifugation"", ""filter"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""filtration"", ""blood gas"", ""anticoagulant agent"", ""centrifuge"", ""processing"", ""placenta weight"", ""bacterium contamination"", ""hollow fiber"", ""adult""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1423-0410.2011.01498-1.x"", ""issn"": ""00429007"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Medical Faculty Hospital, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey , Medical Faculty Hospital, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey, Turhan, A., Medical Faculty Hospital, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 21st Regional Congress of the ISBT, Europe"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2011-06-01"", ""Date revised - 2011-06-03"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.atitle=Evaluation+of+the+usefulness+of+erythrocyte+suspensions+obtained+from+placental+blood+with+centrifugation+and+hollow+fiber+filtration+methods+for+the+autologous+transfusion+of+neonates&rft.au=Turhan%2C+A.&rft.aulast=Turhan&rft.aufirst=A.&rft.date=2011-07-01&rft.volume=101&rft.issue=&rft.spage=62&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Vox+Sanguinis&rft.issn=00429007&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fj.1423-0410.2011.01498-1.x"", ""date"": ""Jul 2011""}"

While coagulopathy prophylaxis in TBI involves replenishing coagulation factors with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), its effectiveness is controversial. We investigated the relationship between plasma fibrinogen concentration 3 h after initiating FFP transfusion and outcomes and evaluated the correlation with D-dimer levels at admission. Methods: We retrospectively examined data from 380 patients with severe isolated TBI with blood samples collected a maximum of 1 h following injury. Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations were obtained at admission, and plasma fibrinogen concentration was again assessed 3–4 h following injury. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received FFP transfusion. Patients were also divided into subgroups according their fibrinogen level: ≥ 150 mg/dL (high-fibrinogen subgroup) or < 150 mg/dL (low-fibrinogen subgroup) 3 h after injury. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data were compared between these subgroups. Results: Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at discharge and 3 months after injury were significantly lower in the FFP transfusion group than in the FFP non-transfusion group. Among patients who received FFP, GOS scores at discharge and 3 months after injury were significantly higher in the high-fibrinogen subgroup than in the low-fibrinogen subgroup. Elevated admission D-dimer predicted subsequent fibrinogen decrease. Conclusions: In FFP transfusion, fibrinogen level ≥ 150 mg/dL 3 h after injury was associated with better outcomes in TBI patients. Assessing the admission D-dimer and tracking the fibrinogen are crucial for optimal coagulopathy prophylaxis in TBI patients.",2019/09/01/,Springer-Verlag Wien,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2261495442?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2261495442; 2002290031"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Blood coagulation disorders"", ""Brain injuries, traumatic"", ""Fibrinogen"", ""Fibrinolysis"", ""Prognosis"", ""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""fibrinogen blood level"", ""fibrinogen"", ""major clinical study"", ""protein function"", ""prophylaxis"", ""endogenous compound"", ""fibrinolysis"", ""fresh frozen plasma"", ""female"", ""human"", ""protein expression"", ""clinical assessment"", ""drug therapy"", ""blood clotting disorder"", ""human tissue"", ""traumatic brain injury"", ""D dimer"", ""prognosis"", ""article"", ""controlled study"", ""Glasgow outcome scale"", ""adult"", ""gene expression"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00701-019-04010-3"", ""issn"": ""00016268"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5, Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan nakae@nms.ac.jp, Emergency and Critical Care Center, Kawaguchi Municipal Medical Center, Saitama, Japan , Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5, Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan, Nakae, Ryuta, Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5, Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8603, Japan"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2019-07-19"", ""Date revised - 2019-08-28"", ""Number of references - 43"", ""Last updated - 2019-08-28"", ""CODEN - ACNUA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Acta+Neurochirurgica&rft.atitle=A+retrospective+study+of+the+effect+of+fibrinogen+levels+during+fresh+frozen+plasma+transfusion+in+patients+with+traumatic+brain+injury&rft.au=Nakae%2C+Ryuta&rft.aulast=Nakae&rft.aufirst=Ryuta&rft.date=2019-09-01&rft.volume=161&rft.issue=9&rft.spage=1943&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Acta+Neurochirurgica&rft.issn=00016268&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00701-019-04010-3"", ""date"": ""2019 Sep 01""}"

Patients and methods. - Over a 25 days period, a hospital neonatal outbreak due to Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum-betalactamase affected 14 newborn infants admitted to a university hospital in Sousse (Tunisia). We collected 21 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum-betalactamase. Susceptibility testing to 17 antibiotics was determined. Macrorestriction genotyping of strains was determined by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. Neonatal intensive care unit survey was undertaken. Results. - A macrorestriction genotyping subdivided 21 strains into 3 clonally groups. Only cefoxitin, colistin, imipenem, amikacin and quinolons were active on the whole of strains.

STUDY DESIGN: The records of all patients evaluated for isoimmunization in pregnancy from January 1992 to December 1994 were reviewed retrospectively. The fetal BVOD had been measured with real-time-directed M-mode fetal echocardiography. The BVOD measurement was plotted on a nomogram (with reference to biparietal diameter) and a percentile value determined graphically from the nomogram. Neonatal outcome was obtained prospectively and by chart review. RESULTS: Sixty-three singleton fetuses from the study period who met entry criteria were identified. Anti-D sensitization represented 66% of cases of isoimmunization. Twenty (32%) fetuses required subsequent neonatal transfusion, and 43 (68%) did not. Seventeen fetuses (27%) had BVOD measurements greater than the 95th percentile, and 10 (59%) required subsequent transfusion. Infants in this group also had significantly lower hematocrits at birth (37.7 +/- 13.0% vs. 46.6 +/- 9.0%) and prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay (10.7 +/- 10.0 vs. 4.7 +/- 3.6 days), respectively, when compared to patients with a BVOD measurement less than the 95th percentile. A BVOD 95th percentile threshold had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 50%, 84% and 59%, respectively, in predicting the need for neonatal transfusion. CONCLUSION: In patients with isoimmunization, a BVOD measurement in the 95th percentile or greater was associated with a relatively high likelihood of neonatal anemia and transfusion. Although the measurement is not sufficiently sensitive to be used as a single parameter in predicting neonatal compromise in these patients, it can be a useful, noninvasive adjunct to the management of isoimmunized pregnancies.",1997,United States,,"{""pmid"": 9219121, ""print_issn"": ""0024-7758"", ""linking_issn"": ""0024-7758"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""0173343"", ""publication_types"": [""Comparative Study"", ""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Anemia, Neonatal"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnosis"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Cohort Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythroblastosis, Fetal"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnostic imaging"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythroblastosis, Fetal"", ""qualifier"": ""embryology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythroblastosis, Fetal"", ""qualifier"": ""physiopathology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Fetal Heart"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnostic imaging"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Fetal Heart"", ""qualifier"": ""physiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Infant, Newborn"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Predictive Value of Tests"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pregnancy"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pregnancy Outcome"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Prospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Rh Isoimmunization"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Ultrasonography, Prenatal"", ""major"": true}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""1997 Jun"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""1997-06-01""}}"

We sought to determine the appropriateness of RBC transfusions at 10 hospitals using retrospective chart review and to determine whether simple metrics (proportion of single-unit transfusions, RBCs/100 acute inpatient days, proportion of transfusions with pretransfusion hemoglobin <80 g/L or posttransfusion hemoglobin <90 g/L) could be used as surrogate markers of appropriateness by comparing their values with the results from the audit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An initial block of 30 RBC units was dually adjudicated for appropriateness followed by additional blocks of 10 units until the difference between the cumulative percentage of appropriate RBC units in the preceding block and final block was <3%. Pearson correlation tests were used to evaluate associations between the metrics and percentages of appropriate transfusions per hospital. Two-by-two tables were used to assess the utility of the metrics to classify transfusions for appropriateness. RESULTS: Of the 498 units audited, 78% were adjudicated as appropriate (κ = 0.9603), with significant variability between institutions (p < 0.0001). Fifty audits or less were required at nine of the institutions. The values of the metrics were not found to have significant correlations with appropriateness, and the metric that misclassified the smallest proportion of transfusions for appropriateness was pretransfusion hemoglobin <80 g/L, at 24%.

The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of blood transfusions and determine factors associated with increased transfusion quantity. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of total 133 patients with >40% total body surface area (TBSA) burns admitted to the burn center of Changhai hospital from January 2008 to December 2013. The study characterized blood transfusions in severe burn patients. Univariate and Multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the association of clinical variables with blood transfusions. RESULTS: The overall transfusion rate was 97.7% (130 of 133). The median amount of total blood (RBC and plasma), RBC and plasma transfusions was 54 units (Interquartile range (IQR), 20-84), 19 units (IQR, 4-37.8) and 28.5 units (IQR, 14.8-51.8), respectively. The number of RBC transfusion in and outside operation room was 7 (0, 14) and 11 (2, 20) units, and the number of plasma was 6 (0.5, 12) and 21 (11.5, 39.3) units. A median of one unit of blood was transfused per TBSA and an average of 4 units per operation was given in the series. The consumption of plasma is higher than that of RBC. On multivariate regression analysis, age, full-thickness TBSA and number of operations were significant independent predictors associated with the number of RBC transfusion, and coagulopathy and ICU length showed a trend toward RBC consumption. Predictors for increased plasma transfusion were female, high full-thickness TBSA burn and more operations. CONCLUSIONS: Severe burn patients received an ample volume of blood transfusions.

Methods: Observational study on consecutive adults supported with VV-ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We targeted an activated partial thromboplastin time of 40 to 50 seconds and a hematocrit of 24% to 30%. Univariate and multiple analyses were done to evaluate factors associated with transfusion requirements and the influence of increasing transfusions on mortality during ECMO. Results: In a cohort of 82 VV-ECMO patients (PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO [PRESERVE] score: 4, Interquartile range [IQR]: 3-5, Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction [RESP] score: 2, IQR: 2-4), 76 (92.7%) patients received at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during the intensive care unit stay related to ECMO (median PRBC/d 156 mL, IQR: 93-218; median ECMO duration 14 days, IQR: 8-22). A higher requirement of PRBC transfusions was associated with pre-ECMO hematocrit, and with the following conditions during ECMO: platelet nadir, antithrombin III (ATIII), and stage 3 of acute kidney injury (all P <.05). Sixty-two (75.6%) patients survived ECMO. Pre-ECMO hospital stay, PRBC transfusion, and septic shock were associated with mortality (all P <.05). The adjusted odds ratio for each 100mL/d increase in PRBC transfusion was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-3.2, P =.01); for the development of septic shock it was 15.4 (95% CI: 1.7-136.8, P =.01), and for each day of pre-ECMO stay it was 1.1 (95% CI: 1-1.2, P =.04). Conclusion: Implementation of a comprehensive protocol for anticoagulation and transfusions in VV-ECMO for ARDS resulted in a low PRBC requirement, and an ECMO survival comparable to data in the literature. Lower ATIII emerged as a factor associated with increased need for transfusions. Higher PRBC transfusions were associated with ECMO mortality.

Methods: Using a case control design, we enrolled 83 patients with severe transfusion-associated circulatory overload identified by active surveillance for hypoxemia and 163 transfused controls at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) hospitals. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, and survival and length of stay were analyzed using proportional hazard models. Results: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload was associated with chronic renal failure (OR 27.0; 95% CI, 5.2-143), a past history of heart failure (OR 6.6; 95% CI, 2.1-21), hemorrhagic shock (OR 113; 95% CI, 14.1-903), number of blood products transfused (OR 1.11 per unit; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22), and fluid balance per hour (OR 9.4 per liter; 95% CI, 3.1-28). Patients with transfusion-associated circulatory overload had significantly increased in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 3.20; 95% CI, 1.23-8.10) after controlling for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score, and longer hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay. Conclusions: The risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload increases with the number of blood products administered and a positive fluid balance, and in patients with pre-existing heart failure and chronic renal failure.

To provide insight into determinants of the decision of intensive care unit (ICU)-physicians to transfuse, a survey study was performed. The reasons of ICU-physicians to transfuse FFP and platelets were determined during a 10-week period. Transfusion triggers were assessed, as well as correction of prolonged coagulation test results. Of 310 admissions, 44 patients (14%) received a transfusion of FFP and 35 patients (11%) received a platelet transfusion. In 67% patients, FFPs were transfused in bleeding patients and in 33% in non-bleeding patients. FFP was transfused at a prothrombin time (PT) of 19 s (17-22). After FFP transfusion, PT levels of 15-18, 18-20 and 20-26 s decreased with a median of 0.7, 1.9 and 3.5 s, respectively. On average, 3.2 FFP units were ordered, of which 28% was not transfused. The major reason to transfuse platelets was bleeding. Platelets were transfused at a platelet count of 95 (36-116) x 10(9) L(-1) in bleeding and 13 (10-18) x 10(9) L(-1) in non-bleeding patients. On average, 1.4 platelet units were ordered, of which 20% was not transfused. The agreement between physicians reporting a major bleeding and a definition of bleeding was poor (kappa < 0.10 for FFP and 0.20 for platelets). In conclusion, one-third of FFP transfusions was given to non-bleeding patients. FFP transfusion failed to normalize prolonged coagulation test results in the majority of the patients.

Evidence suggests that perioperative blood transfusion adversely affects outcome after cardiac surgery. Transfusion risk factors which are amenable to preoperative optimization are anaemia and ceasing antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs. The American Thoracic Society and American Society of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiologists recommend a preop haemoglobin (Hb) of 13 g/dL in elective low risk patients and stopping antithrombotic agents within 12 hours of surgery [1]. We performed an audit to determine if patients with anaemia were optimized preop. Method. The data were collected during patients' stay in the Cardiac Surgical ICU post cardiac surgery. The data included weight, height, age, surgery performed, surgical priority, pre-op haemoglobin (Hb), first and lowest cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) Hb, lowest Hb in the first 24 hour postop., periop. blood transfusion, anti-anaemics given and anticoagulation administered 12 hours pre-op. Analysis was performed. Results. The pre-op Hb in cardiac patients ranged from 9.4 to 17.4 g/dL. 29 patients had a pre-op. Hb <12 g/dL. Of these 29 patients 4 received anti-anaemic therapy. None received erythropoietin. 14 patients received anticoagulation preoperatively. 22 patients had a Hb <7 in the first 24 hours post surgery, 16 were transfused PRC appropriately, 6 did not receive PRC with Hb <7g/dL. Discussion. Not all patients with a Hb <12 g/dL required a blood transfusion. Patients with a pre-op Hb <12 g/dL required packed red cell (PRC) transfusion on 50% of occasions perioperatively. Patients with a pre-op Hb >12 g/dL required PRC transfusion on 20% of occasions perioperatively. These data show that there is complacency for correcting preop. anaemia considering perioperative blood transfusion adversely affects patients' outcome [2].

Damage‐associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, HMGB1 and S100A12, are thought to mediate inflammatory changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to determine whether DAMP are involved in the pathogenesis of TRALI in cardiac surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational trial in cardiac surgery patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a university hospital in the Netherlands. Fourteen TRALI cases were randomly matched with 32 transfused and non‐transfused controls. Pulmonary levels of HMGB1, S100A12 and inflammatory cytokines (interleukins‐1β, ‐6, and ‐8 and tumour necrosis factor‐α) were determined when TRALI evolved. In addition, systemic and pulmonary levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) were determined. RESULTS: HMGB1 expression and levels of sRAGE in TRALI patients did not differ from those in controls. There was a trend towards higher S100A12 levels in TRALI patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, S100A12 levels were associated with increased levels of markers of pulmonary inflammation, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, hypoxemia and duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found that HMGB1 and sRAGE contribute to the development of TRALI. S100A12 is associated with duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary inflammation, hypoxia and prolonged mechanical ventilation and may contribute to acute lung injury in cardiac surgery patients.",2014,PUBMED 24887223,['https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01116189/full'],"{""accession_number"": ""CN-01116189"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Journal article"", ""keywords"": [""Acute Lung Injury [*blood, etiology]"", ""Aged"", ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""Cardiopulmonary Bypass [adverse effects]"", ""Cytokines [blood]"", ""Female"", ""HMGB1 Protein [*blood]"", ""Humans"", ""Male"", ""Middle Aged"", ""Pneumonia, Ventilator‐Associated [blood]"", ""Prospective Studies"", ""Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products"", ""Receptors, Immunologic [*blood]"", ""Respiratory Distress Syndrome [blood, etiology]"", ""S100 Proteins [*blood]"", ""S100A12 Protein"", ""Transfusion Reaction""], ""doi"": ""10.2450/2014.0184-13""}"

We examined coagulation immediately before and after rFVIIa was given; international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) fibrinogen and platelet levels, in addition to the use of red cell and non-red cell blood products, morbidity and mortality. Thirty patients (0.6%) received 31 doses of rFVIIa for bleeding refractory to conventional treatment. Twenty received rFVIIa in theatre after primary surgery, three after re-exploration and eight in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The time-honored gold standard for CABG is the on-pump procedure (ONCAB); however, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is also a safe, cost-benefit procedure with fewer blood transfusion requirements. This study was performed to evaluate transfusion patterns in OPCAB due to the diversity of transfusion practices. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed to determine the transfusion rate and triggers in OPCAB patients. Medical files of all patients undergoing OPCAB surgery at Sanandaj Tohid Hospital in 2014 were reviewed. Patients’ demographics data, preoperative laboratory tests (PT, aPTT, Hb, Hct, Platelet count), underlying medical conditions, and their possible relation to further transfusions and the ward department in which the transfusion had taken place were extracted. SPSS 16 Chicago software, T-student Test, One Way Anova, and χ2 exam were applied for data analysis. P values ≤0.05was considered significant. Results: Among 91 elective OPCAB patients: 28(30.8%) women and 63(69.2%) men with mean age of 64.80±9.02 years, 63(69.23%) received a blood product.

5342b901-7ea5-4623-9263-12e910da0ea2,Effect of erythropoietin and transfusion threshold on neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury: a randomized clinical trial,"['Robertson, CS', 'Hannay, HJ', 'Yamal, JM', 'Gopinath, S', 'Goodman, JC', 'Tilley, BC', 'Baldwin, A', 'Rivera Lara, L', 'Saucedo-Crespo, H', 'Ahmed, O', 'et al.']",JAMA,312,1,36‐47,"IMPORTANCE: There is limited information about the effect of erythropoietin or a high hemoglobin transfusion threshold after a traumatic brain injury. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of erythropoietin and 2 hemoglobin transfusion thresholds (7 and 10 g/dL) on neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial of 200 patients (erythropoietin, n = 102; placebo, n = 98) with closed head injury who were unable to follow commands and were enrolled within 6 hours of injury at neurosurgical intensive care units in 2 US level I trauma centers between May 2006 and August 2012. The study used a factorial design to test whether erythropoietin would fail to improve favorable outcomes by 20% and whether a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of greater than 10 g/dL would increase favorable outcomes without increasing complications. Erythropoietin or placebo was initially dosed daily for 3 days and then weekly for 2 more weeks (n = 74) and then the 24‐ and 48‐hour doses were stopped for the remainder of the patients (n = 126). There were 99 patients assigned to a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 101 patients assigned to 10 g/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous erythropoietin (500 IU/kg per dose) or saline. Transfusion threshold maintained with packed red blood cells. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale score dichotomized as favorable (good recovery and moderate disability) or unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative, or dead) at 6 months postinjury. RESULTS: There was no interaction between erythropoietin and hemoglobin transfusion threshold. Compared with placebo (favorable outcome rate: 34/89 [38.2%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 49.1%]), both erythropoietin groups were futile (first dosing regimen: 17/35 [48.6%; 95% CI, 31.4% to 66.0%], P = .13; second dosing regimen: 17/57 [29.8%; 95% CI, 18.4% to 43.4%], P < .001). Favorable outcome rates were 37/87 (42.5%) for the hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 31/94 (33.0%) for 10 g/dL (95% CI for the difference, ‐0.06 to 0.25, P = .28). There was a higher incidence of thromboembolic events for the transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL (22/101 [21.8%] vs 8/99 [8.1%] for the threshold of 7 g/dL, odds ratio, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79], P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with closed head injury, neither the administration of erythropoietin nor maintaining hemoglobin concentration of greater than 10 g/dL resulted in improved neurological outcome at 6 months. The transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. These findings do not support either approach in this setting.

The methemoglobinemia risk induced by dapsone is known in the literature [1]. Methylene blue is the antidote and can paradoxically itself cause methemoglobinemia. Material and methods: We present a methemoglobinemia case reported at the Marseille poison control center. Results: A 53-year-old man treated for immunological thrombopenic purpura with dapsone ingested approximately 100 tablets of 100 mg of this drug. Three hours later he presented cyanosis and desaturation, followed by seizures requiring intensive care unit transfer. Methemoglobinemia level was measured initially at 22% and then at 28% after the first 1 mg/kg methylene blue infusion. Another infusion is administered 2 hours bringing the methemoglobinemia down to 17%. After a methemoglobinemia increase to 23%, a third antidote infusion is administered. The patient degrades neurologically with a new seizure episode and requires an orotracheal intubation. A fourth infusion is administered the next morning as the methemoglobinemia was at 25%. The third day after the poisoning, it is still at 30%. Methylene blue is abandoned to avoid the risk of exacerbate the methemoglobinemia and repetitive activated charcoal with ascorbic acid are preferred. Neurological and respiratory evolution will be favorable without sequelae for a discharge 6 days after the poisoning. Discussion/Conclusion: Dapsone is one of the numerous drugs known that can cause methemoglobinemia [2]. The antidote used can also cause methemoglobinemia when administered repeatedly, especially during a short period [3]. It is therefore necessary to be attentive to the methemoglobinemia level in order to adjust the treatment and to stop the antidote. The absorption and elimination of the responsible agent can sometimes be long (entero-hepatic cycle) and can sometimes require other therapies use: activated charcoal, ascorbic acid, or even exsanguino-transfusion [2].",2021/06//,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2543543611?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2543543611; 635295359"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""methemoglobinemia"", ""methylene blue"", ""activated carbon"", ""64365-11-3"", ""82228-96-4"", ""ascorbic acid"", ""134-03-2"", ""15421-15-5"", ""50-81-7"", ""dapsone"", ""80-08-0"", ""61-73-4"", ""Embase"", ""poison center"", ""complication"", ""drug therapy"", ""seizure"", ""liver"", ""thrombocytopenic purpura"", ""case report"", ""middle aged"", ""nervous system"", ""clinical article"", ""drug toxicity"", ""conference abstract"", ""intensive care unit"", ""endotracheal intubation"", ""adult"", ""human"", ""male"", ""cyanosis""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12670"", ""issn"": ""14728206"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""APHM, Hôpitaux Sud, Pharmacologie Clinique CAP-TV, Marseille, France , Aix Marseille Univ, APHM, Inserm, IRD, Sesstim, Hôpital Sainte Marguerite Pharmacologie Clinique CAP-TV, Marseille, France , Aix-Marseille Université, Marseille, France , APHM, Hôpitaux Sud, Pharmacologie Clinique CAP-TV, Marseille, France, Reynoard, J., APHM, Hôpitaux Sud, Pharmacologie Clinique CAP-TV, Marseille, France"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - Annual Meeting of French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2021-06-20"", ""Date revised - 2021-06-21"", ""Last updated - 2021-06-21""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Fundamental+and+Clinical+Pharmacology&rft.atitle=Paradoxical+methemoglobinemia%3A+About+a+dapsone+poisoning+case&rft.au=Reynoard%2C+J.&rft.aulast=Reynoard&rft.aufirst=J.&rft.date=2021-06-01&rft.volume=35&rft.issue=SUPPL+1&rft.spage=180&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Fundamental+and+Clinical+Pharmacology&rft.issn=14728206&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Ffcp.12670"", ""date"": ""Jun 2021""}"

We aimed to further evaluate the utility of age-adjusted SI to predict negative outcomes in pediatric trauma. METHODS: We performed an analysis of patients younger than 15 years using the National Trauma Data Bank. Elevated SI was defined as high normal heart rate divided by low-normal blood pressure for age. Our primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included need for a blood transfusion, ventilation, any operating room/interventional radiology procedures, and intensive care unit stay. Multiple logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight thousand seven hundred forty-one cases met the study criteria. The overall mortality rate was 0.7%, and 1.7% had an elevated SI. Patients with an elevated SI were more likely (P < 0.001) to require blood transfusion, ventilation, an operating room/interventional radiology procedure, or an intensive care unit stay. An elevated SI was the strongest predictor for mortality (odds ratio [OR] 22.0) in pediatric trauma patients compared with hypotension (OR, 12.6) and tachycardia (OR, 2.6).

7e1d8bd7-ef0a-41e2-b26e-a55100620346,Incidence of sample collection errors in a network of thirty hospitals within the Quebec hemovigilance system,"['Rioux-Massé, B.', 'Chapdelaine, A.', 'Karl Itaj, N.', 'Robillard, P.']",Transfusion,50,,129A,"Background: Sample collection (SC) errors may be the source of mistransfusions and cause harm to transfusion recipients. This study describes the incidence of SC errors according to the type of medical ward where they occurred in a network of 30 hospitals within the Quebec Hemovigilance System in 2008. Methods: Transfusion errors and adverse transfusion reactions are investigated and reported to the Quebec Hemovigilance System by transfusion safety officers located in 20 designated hospitals that are responsible for transfusion safety in all of Quebec 85 hospitals. A new collection tool (a Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet) to facilitate error reporting in predefined categories was developed and pilot tested in 2007 and implemented in 2008. Denominator data on samples received from each type of ward in blood banks utilizing the new reporting tool was used to calculate incidence of SC errors. Hospitals were divided in small (< 2000 RBC units transfused), medium (2000-< 10000) and large (10000+) size. Results: Thirty-six of the 85 hospitals used the new collection tool in 2008 and 30 provided denominator data. A total of 401,761 samples were received in these 30 hospitals of which 10,115 presented a SC error. In 2006, before implementation of the new collection tool, < 900 SC errors were reported by all Quebec hospitals. The overall incidence of SC errors was 1:40 samples (range: 1:8 to 1:483). Incidence was higher in large hospitals (1:27) compared to medium (1:49) and small (1:42); p < 0.01. As shown in table, incidence of SC errors was higher in emergency rooms (ER) and intensive care units (ICU) [p < 0.001] than in medical/surgical wards (MSW), operating rooms (OR), obstetrics (OBS) and outpatient clinics (OUT). This was also the case for the most serious errors [p < 0.05] grouped under Wrong blood in tube (WBIT) that comprised wrong name on tube, wrong name on tube and on requisition and wrong patient collected. Those errors were not without consequences: 6048 samples had to be recollected and more than 1000 products were destroyed (because of all error types and not only SC errors for the latter). Conclusion: SC errors are extremely frequent (2.5% of all samples received at the blood bank). It is imperative that positive patient identification measures be implemented, especially in high risk areas like ER and ICU. SC errors come with significants cost for both the system and the patients.",2010/09//,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013139097?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013139097; 70288243"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""blood bank"", ""emergency ward"", ""transfusion"", ""ward"", ""blood"", ""blood transfusion reaction"", ""outpatient department"", ""erythrocyte"", ""Canada"", ""tube"", ""patient identification"", ""patient"", ""safety"", ""recipient"", ""risk"", ""intensive care unit"", ""hospital"", ""obstetrics"", ""operating room""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02833-1.x"", ""issn"": ""00411132"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Quebec Public Health Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada benjaminrm@hotmail.com, Quebec Public Health Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada, Epidemiology Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada , Quebec Public Health Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada, Rioux-Massé, B., Quebec Public Health Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - AABB Annual Meeting and CTTXPO"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2010-10-30"", ""Date revised - 2010-11-02"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-03""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Transfusion&rft.atitle=Incidence+of+sample+collection+errors+in+a+network+of+thirty+hospitals+within+the+Quebec+hemovigilance+system&rft.au=Rioux-Mass%C3%A9%2C+B.&rft.aulast=Rioux-Mass%C3%A9&rft.aufirst=B.&rft.date=2010-09-01&rft.volume=50&rft.issue=&rft.spage=129A&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion&rft.issn=00411132&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fj.1537-2995.2010.02833-1.x"", ""date"": ""Sep 2010""}"

However, data based on an objective scoring system are lacking for the impact of these protocols on patients undergoing cardiac surgery other than isolated CABG. Methods: Between March 1999 and March 2003, 299 consecutive patients who underwent open cardiac surgery other than isolated CABG were analyzed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fast-track recovery. The parameters evaluated as predictors of mortality, ie, delayed extubation (>360 minutes), intensive care unit (ICU) discharge (>24 hours), increased length of hospital stay (>5 days), and red blood cell transfusion, were determined by regression analysis. Standard perioperative data were collected prospectively for every patient. Results: Seventy-two percent of the patients were extubated within 6 hours, 87% were discharged from the ICU within 24 hours, and 60% were discharged from the hospital within 5 days. No red blood cells were transfused in 67% of the patients. There were no predictors of mortality. The predictors of delayed extubation were preoperative congestive heart failure (P = .005; odds ratio [OR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-12.6) and peripheral vascular disease (P = .02; OR, 6; 95% CI, 1.9-19.4). Factors leading to increased ICU stay were diabetes (P = .05; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1-12.6), emergent operation (P = .04; OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.1-33.2), red blood cell transfusion (P = .03; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8), chest tube drainage >1000 mL (P = .03; OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.2). The predictors of increased length of hospital stay were ICU stay >24 hours (P = .001; OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2-17), EuroSCORE >5 (P = .05; OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1-3.2), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .003; OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-8.7). Predictive factors for transfusion of red blood cells were diabetes (P = .04; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-8.1), delayed extubation (P = .02; OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.1), increased ICU stay (P = .04; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1-6.4), and chest tube drainage >1000 mL (P = .001; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2-9.3).

METHODS: The study included 39 patients (34 females, 5 males; mean age 68.1 years; range 52 to 88 years) and 16 patients (13 females, 3 males; mean age 66.8 years; range 52 to 83 years) who underwent bilateral TKA for osteoarthritis at a single session and at two separate sessions, respectively. Staged operations were interspersed with a mean interval of 8.3 months (range 2 to 24 months). The two groups were compared with respect to perioperative complications, the amount of blood loss and transfusion, the length of hospitalization, and the overall cost. RESULTS: The amount of blood loss and transfusion, the length of intensive care unit stay, and the occurrence of perioperative complications did not differ significantly between single- and two-staged operations (p>0.05). However, the mean length of hospital stay (10.48 days versus 17.19 days; p=0.01) and the mean overall cost (p=0.03) were significantly less in single-staged operations. Perioperative complications accounted for 12.8% (n=5) and 25% (n=4) in single- and two-staged operations, respectively, all of which developed in patients who had a preexisting cardiologic disease.

The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. Reported measures were operative mortality, pulmonary complications, infective complications, neurological complications, transfusion requirements, duration of ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital stay, intensive care unit re-admission, postoperative gas exchange parameters and postoperative pulmonary function. The largest of the best evidence studies demonstrated a significant reduction in pulmonary complications in non-smokers (P < 0.001); however, there was an increased requirement for transfusion in this cohort (P = 0.002). There were non-significant reductions in neurological complications, infective complications and re-admissions to intensive care. Another large cohort study demonstrated significant reductions in non-smokers in mortality (P < 0.0001), pulmonary complications (P = 0.0002), infection (P < 0.0007), intensive care unit re-admission (P = 0.0002), duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.026) and intensive care unit stay (P = 0.002). A larger cohort study again demonstrated significant reductions in non-smokers in pulmonary complications (P < 0.002), duration of mechanical ventilation (P < 0.012) and intensive care unit stay (P < 0.005). A smaller prospective cohort study reported significantly raised PaO(2) (P = 0.0091) and reduced PaCO(2) (P < 0.0001) levels in the non-smokers as well as improved FVC and FEV(1) (P < 0.0001). There were also reductions in duration of intubation (P < 0.0001), intensive care unit stay (P < 0.0001) and hospital stay (P < 0.0013). Another small cohort study reporting outcomes of heart transplantation demonstrated significant improvement in non-smokers in terms of survival (P = 0.031), duration of intubation (P = 0.05) and intensive care unit stay (P = 0.021). We conclude that there is strong evidence demonstrating superior outcomes in non-smokers following cardiac surgery and advocate the necessity of smoking cessation as soon as possible prior to cardiac surgery.",2012,England,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivs177,"{""pmid"": 22761116, ""electronic_issn"": ""1569-9285"", ""print_issn"": ""1569-9293"", ""linking_issn"": ""1569-9285"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101158399"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Benchmarking"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Evidence-Based Medicine"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Length of Stay"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Complications"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Complications"", ""qualifier"": ""prevention & control"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Risk Assessment"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Risk Factors"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Smoking"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Smoking"", ""qualifier"": ""mortality"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Smoking Cessation"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Smoking Prevention"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Time Factors"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Treatment Outcome"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2012 Oct"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2012-07-05"", ""electronic"": ""2012-07-02""}}"

We hypothesized that percutaneous tracheostomy using progressive dilation over a guide wire and minimum dissection of tissues would be safe to perform without the need for reversal of coagulation defects. Materials & Methods Between November 1, 2008 and June 1, 2009 we identified 32 patients in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City who were clinically coagulopathic and who required tracheostomy. The Cook Blue Rhino system was used at the bedside and bronchoscopic guidance was used on all patients to confirm location and lack of bleeding. Results: Our population was composed of 32 patients who had an International Normalized Ratio (INR) ranging from 1.3 to 3.4 and a platelet count from 14,000 to 244,000. Two patients had liver failure and one patient with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia was on Argatroban. Five patients had Ventricular Assist Devices and 4 had mechanical prosthesis and were on Coumadin with therapeutic INR's. Packing was not routinely used, but 1 patient who had clinical oozing needed to be packed overnight. There was no overt bleeding in the entire series and no patients needed post-operative transfusion for bleeding.

Platelets are innate inflammatory cells and, in addition to their traditional role within haemostasis, are newly considered to have a key role within immunity performing a range of adaptive responses to an antigen challenge. In disease, their immune role is dysregulated and this has been associated with adverse surgical outcomes. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between sepsis and platelet nadir with a platelet count < 60x109/L predicative for surgical complications following liver transplantation (LT). OBJECTIVES. To explore the relationship between platelets, sepsis and outcome measures within our liver transplant cohort. METHODS. A case note review of 97 LTs taking place between 2015- 16 within our centre. Data collected included perioperative transfusion, indices of infection (positive cultures, antibiotic use, CRP and WBC) on Day 0-7, 14, 21 and 28. Platelet count at the same time points was collected. Outcome data included acute kidney injury (AKI) and length of ICU admission. RESULTS. 13% of patients had a platelet drop from baseline (median reduction 18% [range 14-34]). The incidence of platelet rise was 87%; median increase was 38% [25-54]. A significantly higher incidence of AKI (p = 0.032) and longer ITU admission (p = 0.002) was found when the platelet count dropped below 60x109/L postoperatively. Platelet counts on post-operative days (POD) 5, 6 and 7 were significantly lower in patients who developed systemic infection (?sepsis? group) compared to patients who had no evidence of sepsis (""no sepsis"" group): POD5 p = 0.021, POD6 p = 0.006, POD7 p = 0.007. Median time to initiation of antimicrobial therapy was POD 9 (IQR 4-15). Comparison of demographic data, baseline platelet, white cell counts and creatinine, intra- and post-operative transfusion were comparable between groups. While the reduction in platelet count was comparable between both groups, the sepsis group had a slower recovery of platelet count and a lower peak upon recovery (Graph 1). CONCLUSION. Low platelet count is independently associated with worse outcomes, namely increased incidence of post-operative infection, AKI and ICU admission. As with previous research, our results suggest a high suspicion for sepsis is required in patients who are thrombocytopenic following liver transplantation and in these patients a lower threshold for commencing antimicrobial therapy is likely necessary.",2017/09//,SpringerOpen,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1960680408?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1960680408; 619044260"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""creatinine"", ""19230-81-0"", ""60-27-5"", ""Embase"", ""acute kidney failure"", ""thrombocytopenia"", ""antimicrobial therapy"", ""postoperative infection"", ""human cell"", ""leukocyte count"", ""adverse outcome"", ""peroperative complication"", ""thrombocyte count"", ""antibiotic agent"", ""controlled study"", ""liver graft"", ""demography"", ""adult"", ""human"", ""incidence"", ""sepsis"", ""surgery""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-017-0151-4"", ""issn"": ""2197425X"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Royal Free Hospital, Perioperative Research Department, London, United Kingdom , Royal Free Hospital, Perioperative Research Department, London, United Kingdom, Strachan, A., Royal Free Hospital, Perioperative Research Department, London, United Kingdom"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Conference title - 30th Annual Congress of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, ESICM 2017"", ""Copyright - Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2017-11-04"", ""Date revised - 2017-11-06"", ""Last updated - 2017-11-06""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=conference&rft.jtitle=Intensive+Care+Medicine+Experimental&rft.atitle=Adverse+outcomes+including+sepsis+are+associated+with+thrombocytopenia+following+liver+transplantation&rft.au=Strachan%2C+A.&rft.aulast=Strachan&rft.aufirst=A.&rft.date=2017-09-01&rft.volume=5&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Intensive+Care+Medicine+Experimental&rft.issn=2197425X&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs40635-017-0151-4"", ""date"": ""Sep 2017""}"

It is hypothesized that ventilation strategies and restrictive transfusion policies are contributory. The purpose of this study is to examine the changes in ventilation and transfusion parameters over time and their associations with late posttraumatic ARDS. METHODS: The surgical intensive care unit and blood bank databases from a Level I center during a 6-year period were analyzed. All mechanically ventilated trauma patients were screened for ARDS with onset after 48 hours of admission (late ARDS). Demographic, injury, resuscitation, ventilation parameters, and transfusion data were extracted. Variables were analyzed for significant changes during the duration of the study, and independent associations with ARDS were determined. RESULTS: There were 2,346 eligible patients and 192 (8.2%) of them met criteria for late ARDS. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of late ARDS by year (14.9% in 2000 to 3.8% in 2005). When comparing the first and second half of the study, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of patients transfused with packed red blood cells (49.0% versus 40.7%), patients with a peak inspiratory pressure > or = 30 mm Hg (64.9% versus 50.1%), and patients ventilated with a tidal volume/kg > or = 10 mL/kg (39.6% versus 21.8%). Early transfusions, peak inspiratory pressure > or = 30 mm Hg, and fluid balance > or = 2 L in the first 48 hours of admission were independently associated with ARDS.

HyTRs have not been evaluated in the context of universal prestorage leukoreduced blood components. Study Design/ Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of patients with reported HyTR during the years 2011 and 2012 was performed in two large academic medical institutions. Results/Findings: A total of 35 patients had35 HyTRs. US Hemovigilance System classification is described in the Table. All components were prestorage leukoreduced. Red blood cells (RBCs) were implicated in 21 (60.0%) reactions, followed by PLTs and plasma in 11 (31.4%) and 3 (8.6%) reactions, respectively. The mean patient age was 65 y (range 2 mo to 87 y), 5 (14.3%) were pediatric patients (<18 years), and 20 (57.1%) were male. The most frequent clinical setting associated with HyTR was cardiac surgery (n = 14, 40%), followed by hematology/oncology diseases( n = 11, 31.4%), and general surgery (n = 7, 20.0%). Extracorporeal circuits were used within 24 h of the reaction in seven patients (20%), including four patients on dialysis/continuous venous-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and three patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Eighteen (51.4%) patients were in the intensive care unit, seven (20.0%) were in a regular unit, five (14.3%) were in the operating room, and five (14.3%) were in the outpatient setting. Four patients (11.4 %) had received ACEi. Seventeen patients (48.6%) responded well to stopping the transfusion. Thirteen patients (37.1%) had severe reactions and required vasopressors. Conclusion: In the absence of negatively charged leukoreduction filters, other medical situations, such as cardiac surgery or extracorporeal circuits, are frequently associated with HyTR. The pathophysiology of HyTR has yet to be defined. The US Hemovigilance System allows for standardization of transfusion reactions, which may help with their analyses and assist in treatment and prevention.

DESIGN: Self-administered, online, scenario-based survey. SETTING: PICUs in Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and North America. SUBJECTS: Pediatric intensivists. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respondents were asked to report their decisions regarding RBC transfusions, iron, and erythropoietin prescription to children ready to be discharged from PICU, who had been admitted for hemorrhagic shock, cardiac surgery, craniofacial surgery, and polytrauma. Clinical and biological variables were altered separately in order to assess their effect on the management of anemia. Two-hundred seventeen responses were analyzed. They reported that the mean (± SEM) transfusion threshold was a hemoglobin level of 6.9 ± 0.09 g/dL after hemorrhagic shock, 7.6 ± 0.10 g/dL after cardiac surgery, 7.0 ± 0.10 g/dL after craniofacial surgery, and 7.0 ± 0.10 g/dL after polytrauma (p < 0.001). The most important increase in transfusion threshold was observed in the presence of a cyanotic heart disease (mean increase ranging from 1.80 to 2.30 g/dL when compared with baseline scenario) or left ventricular dysfunction (mean increase, 1.41-2.15 g/dL). One third of respondents stated that they would not prescribe iron at PICU discharge, regardless of the hemoglobin level or the baseline scenario. Most respondents (69.4-75.0%, depending on the scenario) did not prescribe erythropoietin. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric intensivists state that they use restrictive transfusion strategies at PICU discharge similar to those they use during the acute phase of critical illness. Supplemental iron is less frequently prescribed than RBCs, and prescription of erythropoietin is uncommon. Optimal management of post-PICU anemia is currently unknown.

We aimed to evaluate in intensive care unit (ICU) patients 1) the feasibility of allocating freshest available compatible RBCs versus standard care and 2) the suitability of this approach in the design of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible patients from two adult ICUs were randomly assigned to receive either the freshest available compatible RBCs or the standard care (the oldest compatible available RBCs) for all transfusions during their ICU stay. Study group allocation was concealed from patients and bedside clinicians, but the transfusion service was unblinded. The study endpoints were the feasibility of the study procedures, including success of the ICU Web randomization, the ICU staff blinding, and the correct delivery of the RBC units by the transfusion service in accordance with the allocated study group. In addition, we measured the difference in age of RBC units between the two groups. RESULTS: During a 3-month period, 177 RBC units were delivered to 51 patients. All study procedures, including randomization, blinding, and delivery of blood in accordance with the study group were successful. The mean (±SD) of the mean age of the RBC received by each patient was lower in the ""fresher blood"" group compared with the standard care group (12.1 [±3.8] days vs. 23 [±8.4] days; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Randomized delivery of the freshest available RBCs versus standard care to ICU patients who were prescribed transfusion for clinical reasons is feasible, with a clinically relevant degree of storage duration separation achievable between the two study groups.

If the ACT is 180‐200 sec., 30 IU/kg. If the ACT is >200 sec., no extra heparin is given. 5 min. after every administration of heparin the ACT is measured. If the ACT is >200 sec, the next ACT measurement is performed every 30 min., until the end of the procedure or until new heparin administration is required. After each new dose of heparin, an ACT measurement is performed after 5 min. and the above‐ described protocol of ACT measurements will be repeated. After re‐establishing blood flow and removing all clamps, the ACT is measured. If the ACT at closure is 200‐250 sec., 25 mg protamine should be administered. If >250 sec., 50 mg protamine. If 180‐200 sec., 10 mg protamine. 5 min. after the administration of protamine, the ACT is measured. The ACT should preferably be below 180 sec. If the ACT is still more than 200 sec., protamine should be administered again. Active Comparator: 5000IU of heparin A single dose of 5 000 IU of heparin is given 3‐5 minutes before clamping of the aorta. No ACT measurements are performed.

Level I and II thrombi are managed with low complication rates by laparotomy alone. Level III and IV thrombi are managed surgically by standard technique i.e. thoracoabdominal tumour resection with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, it requires hepatic mobilization and is associated with complications based on high morbidity and hence less invasive techniques have been developed. Materials and Methods: We present 11 cases of renal cell carcinoma with hepatic and sub hepatic IVC thrombus from 2015 to 2019. We have operated 64 cases of radical nephrectomy, out of which, there were 11 cases of RCC with IVC thrombus. The average age was 61 years. Out of 11 patients, 9 were males and 2 were females. Ten cases were on the right side and one case was on the left side. Results: Of the eleven patients, nine patients needed observation in the intensive care unit (ICU) for one day only. The remaining 2 patients needed observation in ICU for 3 days as they developed pneumonia. 6 patients needed one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion and 5 patients needed 2 units of PRBC transfusion. The average post-operative creatinine was 1.8. The average days of hospitalisation were 10-12 days. There were no wound infections or mortality. Conclusion: For the surgical treatment of RCC with retrohepatic IVC tumour extension, transjugular balloon occlusion of the suprahepatic IVC offers an alternative to extensive hepatic mobilization to obtain suprahepatic thrombus control. Advantages over traditional surgical methods may include decreased surgical time, lower risk of liver injury and tumour embolism.

b391dce8-3709-429e-aa77-b1bc0a9f8e5e,Point-of-care Management of Coagulopathy in Lung Transplantation,"['NCT03598907,']",https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03598907,,,,"Introduction and project description: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) in lung transplant patients is described as acute pulmonary damage occurring early in lung transplantation (in the first 72 hours) (1, 2), sometimes referred to as ischemia ‐ reperfusion injury (1). It is characterized by non‐cardiac pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. Clinically, it is manifested by varying degrees of hypoxemia, along with diffuse infiltrates in the X‐ray of the lung. There are more theories that try to explain the cause of PGD. A number of factors such as cold organ ischemia, mechanical irritation during organ reperfusion, immunological, inflammatory, microbiological factors, and many others associated with lung transplantation (2, 3) may play a roll. Depending on the severity of the clinical symptoms and the severity of X‐ray findings according to International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) there are three types of PGD. The incidence of PGD in its worst form (Grade 3) in early post‐transplantation period is being reported to be present in up to 30% and between 10‐25% within 24‐72 hours after organ reperfusion. Lighter forms of PGD (1st and 2nd degree) occur much more frequently (2,3). Lung affected by PGD is characteristically edematous and the gas exchange is significantly impaired due to damage to the endothelial barrier integrity of the vessels and the epithelial barrier of the lung tissue. The presence of PGD significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients and significantly prolongs the time spent in invasive mechanical ventilation, generally prolongs the time spent in intensive care unit and is a significant risk factor for development of chronic rejection of the transplanted lung (2,3). Lung transplantation is a demanding surgical procedure often associated with the development of coagulopathy and significant bleeding, especially when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used perioperatively, which is practically used in the most cases. Blood loss is replaced by the administration of crystalloid and colloid solutions in order to maintain normovolemia and by administering FFP, which is also used to treat coagulopathy, despite the fact that the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of blood plasma is 1.5‐1.6. These preparations are administered according to the anesthesiologist's experience and practically ,,blindly"". However, their administration in patient significantly immunocompromised may mean a risk of immunomodulation and thus a deterioration of PGD. In addition, the administration of blood plasma is generally associated with higher morbidity and mortality of patients (1). On the other hand, point‐of‐care (POC) monitoring of the hemocoagulation state using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and subsequent targeted coagulopathy therapy during the perioperative period and traumatic life threatening bleeding resulted in decreased bleeding intensity and consumption of transfusion products and this approach led to a reduction in morbidity and mortality of these patients (2,3). Also, methods for evaluating primary haemostasis such as PFA 200 (platelet function analyzer) and aggregometry‐Multiplate can be used as POC methods in the operating room, especially for the diagnosis of coagulopathy accompanying the use of ECMO, especially for the diagnosis of von Willebrand's disease (PFA 200) or for the diagnosis of thrombocytopathy (Multiplate) (1‐4). Therefore, it can reasonably be assumed that a similar positive benefit of this POC approach can be expected even in patients undergoing lung transplantation. Hypothesis: Methodology: 1. before lung transplantation, upon patient arrival to hospital before surgery (as a control) 2. after lung transplantation, during admission of patient to postoperative intensive care unit All methods ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate are used to predict bleeding in cardiac surgery and hepatic transplantation, and targeted therapy based on their results is associated with a reduction in blood transfusion (FFP, platelets, erythrocytes) administration, reduced bleeding and reduced morbidity and mortality (5‐7). In this prospective controlled randomized study of 120 lung transplant patients, investigators want to compare the incidence of PGD between a group of patients treated by standard ,,blind"" approach and a ,,new"" POC approach. Investigators assume that in a group where diagnosis and therapy of coagulopathy and bleeding will be managed based on the results of the ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate tests, the clot strength will be increased and this will lead to reduced perioperative blood loss, reduced administration of infusion solutions and FFP and this will subsequently lead to reduced incidence of PGD. Point‐of‐care approach to diagnosis of perioperative coagulopathy with ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate and its subsequent aimed therapy will improve blood clot and thus will reduce blood loss, fluid infusion, blood transfusion and subsequently the incidence of PGD. Patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation (120 patients) will be randomized into 2 groups using computerised generator of random numbers. The study protocol will be registered in the Clinical Research Database and a clinical trial number (CTN) will be obtained and written informed consent will be obtained from patients before lung transplantation. The first group of existing ,,standard care"" ‐ the approach to bleeding patient will be based on clinical experience of the anaesthetist, practically meaning administering crystalloids, colloids (hydroxyethyl starch or gelatin), fresh frozen plasma and erythrocytes to restore normovolemia and platelets, fibrinogen, prothrombin complex concentrate, von Willebrand factor, tranexamic acid, all products giving ,,blindly"" when it comes to diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. The second group of ,,point‐of‐care"" approach to the diagnosis and treatment of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy will be conducted on the basis of the results of the POC methods ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate (prothrombin complex concentrate, fibrinogen, platelets, von Willebrand factor, tranexamic acid). A solution of 5% albumin and erythrocytes (to keep haemoglobin level over 100 g/l as it is critical for normal primary haemostasis) will be used to keep normal circulating volume and to compensate for perioperative blood loss. Blood samples will obtained and analysed by ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate, as well as the level and function of von Willebrand factor (multimers assay, ristocetin cofactor and collagen binding assay) will be performed in all patients: 3. in the ,,POC"" group also in the operating room (ROTEM, Multiplate and PFA 200) during surgery The PGD score will be evaluated post‐operatively and in the following way: severity of PGD is defined in four degrees and is evaluated using partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and inspired fraction of oxygen ratio (FiO2) ratio and simultaneously evaluating X‐ray finding of the lungs as soon as possible after reperfusion (time 0) and after 48 and 72 hours after lung reperfusion. ‐ Grade 0 ‐ PaO2/FiO2 ratio of any value but no pulmonary edema on chest X‐ray ‐ Grade 1 ‐ PaO2/FiO2 > 300 and presence of pulmonary edema on chest X‐ray ‐ Grade 2 ‐ PaO2/FiO2 200 ‐ 300 and and presence of pulmonary edema on chest X‐ray ‐ Grade 3 ‐ PaO2/FiO2 < 200 and presence of pulmonary edema on chest X‐ray or patients in need of postoperative ECMO support or nitric oxide therapy To exclude the possible thrombotic complication of any of these approaches, each patient will be screened ultrasonographically for venous thrombosis 72 hours postoperatively (vena poplitea, vena femoralis, vena jugularis, and vena subclavia bilat) and thrombotic complications will compared between groups. Also other parameters will be compared between groups: ‐ clot strength and whole coagulation profile before and after surgery using ROTEM, PFA 200 and Multiplate and evaluation of the functional level of von Willebrand factor. Correlation of coagulation profile with blood loss in the operating room and postoperative blood loss will be also assessed. ‐ amount of perioperative blood loss in the operating room at the end of surgery and 24 hours after surgery (blood loss will measured as amount of blood in the suction container in operating room and as amount of blood in the chest drain in ICU postoperatively) ‐ number of transfusion products administered in operating room and in postoperative ICU ‐ duration of invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation and time to extubation (hours), duration of stay in the postoperative ICU and overall in hospital before discharge home (days) ‐ morbidity of patients (SOFA score at 24, 48 and 72 hours after lung transplantation), morbidity and mortality among patients in 30, 90 and 365 days ‐ incidence of lung graft rejection during whole period of hospitalisation Time schedule: 4 years During the 3‐years period recruitment of patients will be done and in the 4‐th year data will be analysed and published in valuable journals. Investigators expect a lower consumption of blood transfusion products and infusion solutions in the POC group.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of data on patients with blunt trauma and open pelvic fractures admitted to our trauma center over a 5-year period (January 2013 to December 2017). Demographic as well as clinical data including injury mechanism, injury severity score (ISS), fracture classifications, transfusion requirements, interventions, length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and prognosis were investigated. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify the risk variables of death. Finally, a brief literature review was performed to understand the current capacity of treatment and prognosis of this type of injury. Results: Forty-six patients (36 male and 10 female) were included in this study, mean age 43.2 ± 14.2 years. The overall mortality rate was 17.4%; 43.5% of the patients were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg) on arrival. The average ISS was 31.7 ± 6.7, and the average packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion during the first 24 h was 9.6 ± 7.4 units. Five patients (10.9%) underwent transcatheter arterial embolization in the early stage of management. The average hospital and ICU length of stay were 53.0 ± 37.6 days and 14.3 ± 15.3 days, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found in ISS, PRBC units received with the first 24 h, SBP, lactate and base excess on admission, and mechanism of injury when comparing between the death and the survival groups (p < 0.05). ISS and lactate on admission were found to be the independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusion: The mortality rate of open pelvic fractures remains high. ISS and lactate on admission were the independent risk factors for mortality.

ExT was subsequently applied to other causes of neonatal hyperbiliribinaemia, severe neonatal anaemia from a variety of causes, some non-immune hydrops cases, Neonatal metabolic conditions such as hyperammonaemia, severe hyperkalaemia and neonatal haemochromatosis. In the 1970's when ExT was exclusively used for the management of HDN, Lucey et al, predicted a decrease in frequency of this procedure for HDN in future. Complications were estimated to increase due to the lack or decreased frequency of ExT with time. Objectives To determine. Number of ET done over a 6 yr period. Patients demographics, time of ExT, Indications. Number of Babies who have had Inutero ExT. Maternal details: Blood group, antibodies. The level of bilirubin at which transfusion took place. Prior treatment pre-ExT: In-utero Tx, Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) use; use of albumin infusion. The ExT-related complications: Any complication not present prior to the ET which occurred within 48 hrs after the ET: Defined as follows- platelet count <150, hypocalaemia, ionised Calcium <0.8, fits, raised INR. Methods Setting: Level 3 NICU. Retrospective notes review of patients who underwent ExT. January 2008-March 2014 (6.25 yrs). Exclusion criteria: Those for which notes were not obtained. Results Total admissions to the NICU over the period = 5,000. Number of exchange transfusions done= 15 in 14 patients. 0.3% of admissions over the period. Table of cases. Conclusion Average ExT/yr in a Level 3 NICU = 2.4/yr. ExT is currently being used for a variety of causes. There were no complications related to the procedure itself.

cc8f39af-9c33-4aac-b864-5360736a0b06,Prognostic significance of admission base deficit for blood transfusion rate in critically ill adult patients,"['Petrosyan, K.A.']",New Armenian Medical Journal,4,3,31,"Background: In intensive care medicine the clinical decision to transfuse red blood cells (RBC) is usually based on hematocrit or hemoglobin levels. However, these values at the admission to intensive care unit (ICU) cannot predict the necessity in blood transfusion in critically ill patients during their stay in ICU. Certain laboratory variables, particularly base deficit (BD) have been shown to be a valuable indicator of shock, fluid requirements, efficacy of resuscitation and to be predictive of mortality and blood transfusion after trauma. Purpose: The goal of this study was to investigate whether BD taken on admission could be used to predict the frequency of blood transfusion in critically ill patients with anemia during their stay in ICU. Material and Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of 96 patients admitted to the multiprofile ICU of tertiary care hospital from September 2008 to April 2010 was done. Patients who had an arterial blood gas obtained within 1 hour of admission and with history of RBC transfusion during intensive therapy were included. The patients were subdivided into 3 categories depending on the BD level on admission: Category 1: BD-2, 17 patients (17.71%); Category 2:-3-BD-6, 28 patients (29.17%); Category 3: BD -7, 51 patients (53.13%). Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square test. Results: Transfusion requirements increased with BD level worsening. Twelve patients (70.59%) in Category 1 had one history of transfusion and 5 patients (29.1%) had more than one transfusion. In Category 2, 18 (64.29%) had one and 10 patients (35.71%) had more than one transfusion. The same values for Category 3 were as follows: 21 patients (41.17%) required one and 30 patients (58.82%) more than one transfusion. (p< 0.001, chi2 =14.86). Conclusions: Admission BD identifies patients likely to require frequent transfusions. In a group with severe BD level -7 at the time of admission critically ill patients required frequent transfusions of RBCs during their stay in ICU. These data show that the BD is an early available important indicator to identify patients with high transfusion requirements.",2010/09//,UNIPRINT,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/1013569228?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""1013569228; 70707739"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Conference Abstract"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""blood transfusion"", ""critically ill patient"", ""tertiary health care"", ""intensive care"", ""chi square test"", ""hematocrit"", ""transfusion"", ""anemia"", ""erythrocyte"", ""hemoglobin blood level"", ""medical record"", ""liquid"", ""laboratory"", ""patient"", ""non profit organization"", ""arterial gas"", ""mortality"", ""resuscitation"", ""intensive care unit"", ""injury"", ""adult"", ""hospital"", ""statistical analysis"", ""human""], ""issn"": ""18200254"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Yerevan State Medical University after M.

We removed autologous blood from the patient before bypass and used isovolumetric substitution. We present the results of this protocol on morbidity and mortality of surgery patients from two distinct time periods. Methods: Patients from the two surgical phases were enrolled in this retrospective study in order to compare the outcomes using autologous or homologous blood in open-heart surgery. A total of 323 patients were included in the study. The autologous transfusion group (group 1) comprised 163 patients and the homologous transfusion group (group 2) 160 patients. In group 1, autologous bloods were prepared via a central venous catheter that was inserted into the right internal jugular vein in all patients, using the isovolumetric replacement technique. The primary outcome was postoperative in-hospital mortality and mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included the length of stay in hospital and in intensive care unit (ICU), time for extubation, re-intubations, pulmonary infections, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, renal disease, allergic reactions, mediastinitis and sternal dehiscence, need for inotropic support, and low cardiac-output syndrome (LCOS). Results: The mean ages of patients in groups 1 and 2 were 64.2 ± 10.3 and 61.5 ± 11.6 years, respectively. Thirty-eight of the patients in group 1 and 30 in group 2 were female. There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality in either group. The mean extubation time, and ICU and hospital stays were significantly shorter in group 1. Furthermore, postoperative drainage amounts were less in group 1. There were significantly fewer patients with postoperative pulmonary complications, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation and renal disease. The number of patients who needed postoperative inotropic support and those with low cardiac output was also significantly less in group 1. Conclusion: Autologous blood transfusion is a safe and effective method in carefully selected patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It not only prevents transfusion-related co-morbidities and complications but also enables early extubation time and shorter ICU and hospital stay.

c1b1abc5-0ecf-4ebe-917f-cfa149a54529,Liberal vs. restrictive transfusion thresholds in leukemia patients: a feasibility pilot study,"['De Zern, AE', 'Williams, K', 'King, KE', 'Hand, W', 'Levis, MJ', 'Smith, BD', 'Gojo, I', 'Pratz, KW', 'Gondek, LP', 'Prince, GT', 'et al.']",Blood,126,23,771,"Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is vitally important for the care of patients (pts) undergoing myelosuppressive therapy for acute leukemia (AL). At diagnosis and before bone marrow recovery, RBCs are given liberally with hemoglobin (Hb) transfusion triggers of 8‐9 g/dL or higher, often with two RBC units given at a time. Research in a variety of non‐oncologic settings suggests that lower Hb triggers (7‐8 g/dL) do not increase mortality whereas higher Hb triggers (9 g/dL) may increase mortality. For pts with hematologic malignancies, the ideal Hb threshold is unknown. Also, there is literature to suggest that higher Hb values force platelets to the periphery of capillaries and reduce bleeding events. A study of red cell triggers in pts with thrombocytopenia (as in AL) is important as we may not be able to rely on trigger data from others in this setting. This feasibility study was designed to determine whether a randomized trial of Hb triggers could be performed and what challenges may be encountered with this select population. In this prospective randomized study, we enrolled adult pts with AL (myeloid and lymphoid) undergoing intensive induction therapy to evaluate both patient and physician tolerance for a transfusion threshold of 7g/dL (LOW) compared to the standard threshold of 8g/dL (HIGH), as well as operationalize transfusion to a single unit per episode. Pts were randomized with a 2:1 ratio of LOW threshold to HIGH threshold. Pts were ineligible if there was clinical concern for acute coronary syndrome or active blood loss. Pts were monitored from the study enrollment date through the next marrow evaluation after completion of induction therapy. Vital status at Day 60, accrual rate, and safety endpoints (mortality, length of stay, infection, fatigue scores, renal, respiratory, thrombotic, bleeding events) were monitored. Total transfusions, length of inpatient stay, and percentage of pts who crossed over to HIGH threshold for symptomatic reasons were also monitored. Between April 15, 2014 and July 23, 2015, 162 acute leukemia pts would have been eligible for this trial. Of the eligible pts, 112 (69%) were approached and 90 (of planned 90) have enrolled to date. Twenty‐two pts (19.6%) of those offered the trial declined. Seventy‐four pts are currently evaluable for response (13 pts have not been on‐study long enough to evaluate and 3 pts are not eligible for data analysis): 51 pts in LOW arm and 23 in HIGH arm. Interim data is shown in Table 1. In the LOW arm, three pts withdrew consent due to self‐reported fatigue and one patient was removed by physician due to clinical scenario. Seventeen pts (33%) in the LOW arm and six pts (26%) in the HIGH arm were transfused outside their hemoglobin trigger without meeting criteria to discontinue the study. No deaths were attributable to Hb thresholds in this study. Significant bleeding events (Grade 3 or 4 by CTCAE 4.0) were comparable with 4 in LOW arm and 3 in HIGH arm. More minor bleeding events (Grade 1 or 2 by CTCAE 4.0) were higher in LOW (24 events) than in HIGH arm (15 events). Acute leukemia and its therapies carry a significant mortality risk and it is not clear how transfusion thresholds and number of PRBC units transfused impact this mortality. Furthermore, blood is an expensive and scarce resource. Without a clear benefit of higher Hb thresholds, the added risks and costs of transfusion may not be justified. This pilot study shows that both pts and leukemia physicians will tolerate randomization between Hb thresholds and there is not a signal for harm in either Hb threshold at present. Pts in the LOW arm receive fewer transfusions and do not experience higher fatigue scores nor increased significant bleeding events. Length of hospitalization was similar in both arms. This safety data will serve as a platform for a larger mortality study in leukemia and possibly additional studies in other oncologic diseases.

METHODS: In a controlled clinical trial conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit of Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, between April 2002 to April 2004, 60 premature infants with gestational age up to 34 weeks, birth weight up to 1500 g, and postnatal age between 8 and 14 days were included. The newborns were randomized into 2 groups: Group 1 received 3 doses of 400 IU/kg erythropoietin per week for 6 weeks, and Group 2 received no treatment aside from their conventional medications. RESULTS: The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to their mean gestational age, birth weight and hematocrit at the study entry. Fewer transfusions were administered to those receiving erythropoietin (26.7% versus 50%, p=0.03), but there was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to volume of transfusion. Compared with the placebo group, the infants receiving erythropoietin had a higher mean hematocrit (34% +/- 4.3 versus 29% +/- 5.9, p<0.001) and absolute reticulocyte count (57 +/- 19 versus 10 +/- 4.8 x 106, p<0.001) at the end of the study.

Paul', 'Winn, H. Richard', 'Le Roux, Peter']",Neurosurgery,66,2,312-318,"Objective: Red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) is associated with medical complications in general medical and surgical patients. We examined the hypothesis that RBCT during intensive care unit (ICU) care is associated with medical complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a prospective observational database containing 421 patients with SAH (mean age, 51.5 years; standard deviation, 14.6 years). Logistic regression models were used to adjust for age, admission hemoglobin (Hgb), clinical grade, average ICU Hgb, and symptomatic vasospasm. Results: Two hundred fourteen patients received an RBCT during their ICU stay. Medical complications were identified in 156 patients and were more common in those who received blood (46%) than in those who did not (29.8%) (P < .001). Major medical complications (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic) occurred in 111 patients, and minor complications (eg, skin rash, deep vein thrombosis) occurred in 45 patients. Any non-central nervous system infection (n = 183; P < .001), including pneumonia (n = 103; P < .001) or septicemia (n = 36; P = .02), was more common with RBCT. Central nervous system infections (meningitis, cranial wound, n = 15) also were associated with RBCT (P = .03). Mechanically ventilated patients (n = 259) were more likely to have received an RBCT than those who did not (P < .001). When logistic regression was used to control for age, admission clinical grade and Hgb, average ICU Hgb, symptomatic vasospasm, and other admission variables associated with outcome, the following factors (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval) were associated with RBCT: any medical complication (1.8; 1.1-3.0), major medical complications (2.1; 1.2-3.7), any infection (2.8; 1.7-4.5), pneumonia (2.6; 1.5-4.7), septicemia (2.9; 1.2-6.8), and need for mechanical ventilation (2.8; 1.5-5.1). Conclusion: These data suggest that RBCTs are associated with medical complications after SAH. However, the data do not infer causation, and further study is necessary to better define the indications for transfusion after SAH.

We hypothesized that plasma was associated with improved survival to hospital discharge in adult trauma patients presenting with isolated TBI (iTBI). METHODS: Retrospective review of adult trauma patients from 2011 to 2015 with iTBI defined as head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) >3 and AIS of all other body regions <3. Patients were dichotomized into “plasma” or “no plasma” groups based on transfusion of plasma within 4 hours of presentation. A purposeful multivariate logistic regression model was constructed. After testing for interaction, sub-group analysis was performed based on pattern of brain injury on initial head CT. RESULTS: Of the 656 patients included for analysis, 197 (30%) received plasma. These patients were older, more severely injured, more coagulopathic, more hypotensive, and less likely to survive (all p<0.03). After adjustment for covariates, plasma was not asso-ciated with improved survival in all patients (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.66-1.71). The largest subgroup was multifocal intracranial hemorrhage (MIH) (defined as at least 2 different types of brain lesions without a dominant lesion on initial head CT) with 259 (39%) patients.

The first-line treatment for BCVIs is antithrombotics, but consensus on the optimal choice and timing of treatment is lacking. Methods: This was a retrospective study on patients aged at least 18 years admitted to 6 level 1 trauma centers between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2017 with grade 1-4 BCVI and treated with antithrombotics. Differences in treatment practices were examined across the 6 centers. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke, and secondary outcomes were related to bleeding complications: blood transfusion and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Treatment characteristics examined were time to diagnosis and first computerized tomography angiography, time of total treatment course, time on each antithrombotic (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, combination), time from hospital arrival to antithrombotic initiation, and treatment interruption, i.e., treatment halted for a surgical procedure and restarted postoperatively. Chi-square, Fisher exact, Spearman's rank-order correlation, Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were used to evaluate associations with the outcomes. Results: A total of 189 patients with BCVI were included. The median (IQR) time from arrival to antithrombotic initiation was 27 (8-61) hours, and 28% of patients had treatment interrupted. The ischemic stroke rate was 7.5% (n = 14), with most strokes (64%, n = 9) occurring between arrival and treatment initiation. Treatment interruption was associated with ischemic stroke (75% of patients with stroke had an interruption versus 24% of patients with no stroke; P < .01). Time on anticoagulants was not associated with ischemic stroke (P = .78), transfusion (P = .43), or ICH (P = .96). Similarly, time on antiplatelets (P = .54, P = .65, P = .60) and time on combination therapy (P = .96, P = .38, P = .57) were not associated with these outcomes. Conclusions: The timing and consistency of antithrombotic administration are critical in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with BCVI. Most ischemic strokes in this study population occurred between arrival and antithrombotic initiation, representing events that may potentially be intervened upon by earlier treatment.

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of data from a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Thirty-five ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. PATIENTS: Cohort of 1,465 patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level replacement therapy study. INTERVENTIONS: Daily information on morning hemoglobin level and amount of RBC transfused were prospectively collected in the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level study. We analyzed the epidemiology of such transfusions and their association with clinical outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 977 patients(66.7%) received a total of 1,192 RBC units. By day 5, 785 of 977 transfused patients (80.4%) had received at least one RBC transfusion. Hemoglobin at randomization was lower in transfused than in nontransfused patients (94 vs 111 g/L; p < 0.001). Mean daily hemoglobin was 88 ± 7 and 99 ± 12 g/L in transfused and nontransfused patients. Among transfused patients, 228 (46.7%) had died by day 90 when compared with 426 (43.6%) of nontransfused patients (p = 0.27). Survivors received on average 316 ± 261 mL of RBC, whereas nonsurvivors received 302 ± 362 mL (p = 0.42). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, RBC transfusion was independently associated with lower 90-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.79). However, we found no independent association between RBC transfusions and mortality when the analyses were restricted to patients surviving at least 5 days (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.90-1.85). We found no independent association between RBC transfusion and renal replacement therapy-free days, mechanical ventilator-free days, or length of stay in ICU or hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe acute kidney injury treated with continuous renal replacement therapy, we found no association of RBC transfusion with 90-day mortality or other patient-centered outcomes.

T-activated RBCs react with the lectins Arachis hypogea and Glycine soja; variants of T (Th and Tx) and Tk also react with A. hypogea, but not G. soja. Although Tk is not a true variant of T, for the purposes of this study, all RBCs that are reactive with A. hypogea but are not reactive with G. soja are called ""T variants."" STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out to examine T and T variant activation and transfusion-associated hemolysis in a neonatal intensive care population and to determine if antibodies to T and T variant are detectable in donor plasma. A total of 2041 samples from 375 infants were tested for T and T variant activation utilizing a lectin panel. Three hundred donor plasma samples were tested for antibodies to T and T variant. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 375 infants (12.8%) had T- and T-variant-activated RBCs. Of these, 13 of 48 (27%) developed at least one episode of sepsis and 9 of 48 (19%) developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) at some point during their inpatient stay. T activation was not always temporally associated with the onset of NEC or sepsis. The remaining 26 of 48 (54%) were healthy infants receiving convalescent care in the neonatal intensive care units and showed no evidence of either NEC or sepsis. Twelve (of 375) additional infants (3.2%) who developed NEC and 100 (27%) who developed sepsis showed no RBC T activation. Twenty-three of 48 (48%) infants with T-activated RBCs received standard blood components, but no transfusion-associated hemolysis occurred. Donor plasma samples contained T but not T variant antibodies. CONCLUSION: T variant activation of RBCs occurs in healthy neonates as well as in infants with NEC and sepsis, but T activation appears rare. Transfusion- associated hemolysis was not seen. The provision of specially prepared blood components for infants with NEC is unnecessary.",2002/11//,,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/693896841?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""693896841; 35514279"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""immunoglobulin M"", ""9007-85-6"", ""sialidase"", ""9001-67-6"", ""soybean protein"", ""9010-10-0"", ""MEDLINE"", ""Thomsen Friedenreich antibodies"", ""Thomsen-Friedenreich antibodies"", ""sialidase -- pharmacology"", ""lectin"", ""drug effect"", ""beta galactosyl(1 3) N acetylgalactosamine"", ""erythrocyte membrane"", ""hemolysis"", ""utilization review"", ""tumor antigen"", ""blood donor"", ""Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen, cryptic"", ""newborn intensive care"", ""blood component therapy"", ""gestational age"", ""human"", ""trisaccharide"", ""chemistry"", ""blood transfusion"", ""antibody"", ""peanut agglutinin"", ""erythrocyte transfusion -- adverse drug reaction"", ""microbiology"", ""United Kingdom"", ""newborn"", ""plant lectin"", ""soybean lectin"", ""blood"", ""article"", ""enzymology"", ""Thomsen Friedenreich antigen, cryptic"", ""beta-galactosyl(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine"", ""necrotizing enterocolitis"", ""bacterial protein -- pharmacology"", ""prospective study"", ""metabolism"", ""sepsis""], ""issn"": ""00411132"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""National Blood Service, Brentwood Center, Essex, United Kingdom. , National Blood Service, Brentwood Center, Essex, United Kingdom., Boralessa, H., National Blood Service, Brentwood Center, Essex, United Kingdom."", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record."", ""Date created - 2002-11-07"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-19"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Transfusion&rft.atitle=RBC+T+activation+and+hemolysis+in+a+neonatal+intensive+care+population%3A+implications+for+transfusion+practice&rft.au=Boralessa%2C+Harischandra&rft.aulast=Boralessa&rft.aufirst=Harischandra&rft.date=2002-11-01&rft.volume=42&rft.issue=11&rft.spage=1428&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Transfusion&rft.issn=00411132&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""Nov 2002""}"

Priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with patients' own blood [retrograde autologous priming (RAP)] is a technique used to limit haemodilution and reduce transfusion requirements. We designed this study to evaluate the effects of RAP on reducing perioperative blood transfusion in small adults. Methods One hundred and twenty patients with a body surface area of less than 1.5 m2 undergoing first-time, nonemergency cardiac surgery were randomized to either the standard priming group or the RAP group. All patients followed strict transfusion criteria. Homologous transfusion, haematocrit, plasma colloid osmotic pressure and postoperative clinical outcomes were evaluated perioperatively. Results Patient characteristics and operative parameters were equal for patients in both groups. With autologous priming, a mean volume of 614.8 ± 138.8 ml of priming solution was replaced with autologous blood. This allowed a significantly higher haematocrit value during cardiopulmonary bypass (P<0.05). Red blood cell transfusion was necessary in 83.3% of patients of the standard priming group on pump, whereas only 26.7% of patients of the RAP group required transfusion (P<0.01). The overall transfusion rate of the RAP group was significantly less than that in the standard priming group during the hospitalization (90.0 vs. 50.0%, P<0.01). Amongst patients who received transfusion on pump, the number of homologous units of packed red blood cells was less in the RAP group than that in the standard priming group intraoperatively and perioperatively (0.94 ± 0.32 vs. 1.48 ± 0.68 units, P = 0.03; 1.24 ± 0.54 vs. 1.69 ± 0.69 units, P = 0.15). Ten minutes after aortic cross-clamp, colloid osmotic pressure was reduced by 39.7 ± 2.8% in the standard priming group and by 28.6 ± 3.2% in the RAP group (P<0.05). Clinical outcomes were similar with respect to pulmonary, renal and hepatic function, length of ICU stay and hospital stay. Conclusion RAP resulted in a significant decrease in intraoperative haemodilution and conserved the use of blood. This technique should be considered for patients with a small body surface area (<1.5m2) undergoing open heart surgery.

This study compares the outcomes of the patients treated with a new algorithm with those of patients managed with our traditional approach. Methods: The data of 247 consecutive patients who had aortic surgery were analyzed. The 158 patients (group 1) who were managed with our usual algorithm were compared with the 89 patients (group 2) who were treated with the novel algorithm consisting of utilization of the patient's own platelet rich plasma, fibrinogen, and prothrombin cell concentrates. Differences in transfusion and intensive care unit stay were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable robust regression analyses were performed. Results: In comparison with group 1, patients in group 2 had significantly reduced need for transfusion of red cells (7.9 ± 8.6 vs 3.5 ± 3.8 units, P < .001). Postoperative intubation time was reduced from a mean of 42 hours to a mean of 12 hours (P < .001). The time to medical discharge from the intensive care unit was reduced from a mean of 7 days to a mean of 5 days (P < .001), favoring the new algorithm.

Does the PELD score or HARI predict outcome after LT for biliary atresia? Twenty consecutive children who underwent LT for biliary atresia between 2001 and 2005 were reviewed. Their PELD score was calculated periodically between listing and transplantation and HARI was measured at listing. Outcome variables were operative blood transfusion requirements, ICU stay and postoperative stay. Median age at LT was 8 (2-204) months. After allowing for the type of graft, the PELD score and the change in PELD score between listing and LT (deltaPELD) showed no significant correlation with blood transfusion requirements, but both the PELD score at listing and deltaPELD showed a trend toward a statistically significant positive correlation with overall hospital stay. Pre-transplant HARI showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the PELD score at listing (r = 0.46, p = 0.05) but did not correlate significantly with hospital stay. In this relatively small but homogeneous group of children undergoing LT for biliary atresia, PELD, and deltaPELD scores showed a trend toward a statistically significant positive correlation with overall hospital stay.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare HCR with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a range of clinical outcomes and hospital costs. METHODS: To identify potential studies, systematic searches were carried out in various databases. The key search terms included ""hybrid revascularization"" AND ""coronary artery bypass grafting"" OR ""HCR"" OR ""CABG."" This was followed by a meta-analysis investigating the need for blood transfusion, hospital costs, ventilation time, hospital stay, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, mortality, postoperative atrial fibrillation, renal failure, operation duration, and ICU stay. RESULTS: The requirement for blood transfusion was significantly lower for HCR: odds ratio 0.38 (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.31-0.46, P < .00001) as was the hospital stay: mean difference (MD) -1.48 days (95% CI, -2.61 to -0.36, P = 0.01) and the ventilation time: MD -8.99 hours (95% CI, -15.85 to -2.13, P = .01). On the contrary, hospital costs were more expensive for HCR: MD $3970 (95% CI, 2570-5370, P < .00001). All other comparisons were insignificant.

The optimum platelet transfusion threshold in pediatric intensive care unit patients is not known and varies with clinical condition. We analyzed our pediatric intensive care unit patients who received platelet transfusions, to determine our practice in four clinical conditions. Methods: We retrieved target patient population data from our blood bank database from 2009-2010. Patients were subdivided in to four subgroups: hematologic (hematologic malignancies, bone marrow suppression, hemolytic anemia, and sickle cell disease), surgical (post-surgical, trauma and acute bleeding), unstable (FiO2 > 0.6 and/or inotropic support), and stable patients. Critically ill children between 1 month and 21 years of age were enrolled. We excluded patients who underwent ECMO. Results: A total of 197 transfusion episodes in 64 patients were analyzed. The distribution of transfusions episodes included hemotologic 82% (n=161), surgical 7% (n=13), unstable 8% (n=16), stable 3% (n=7). The mean (SD) pre-transfusion platelet count (×1000) in all patients and children in hemotologic, surgical, unstable and stable groups were 29 (22), 29 (19), 47 (46), 28 (19), and 24 (14) respectively. The transfusion threshold for surgical group was higher compared to hematologic and unstable groups (p<0.001; ANOVA with multiple comparison test). The mean platelet count during all episodes increased from 29 (22) to 71 (57) (p<0.05; paired t-test). The mean platelet count increased significantly higher after transfusion among surgical and unstable patients compared to hematologic patients (p<0.001; ANOVA with multiple comparison test). Conclusions: The most common indication for platelet transfusion in our PICU was underlying hematologic condition. The threshold for platelet transfusion varied with the clinical condition and is higher among surgical patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 134 patients scheduled for heart surgery were randomized to receive Ringer's lactate 1,500mL in the priming reservoir (group C), or mannitol 20% 250mL, albumin 20% 150mL and Ringer's lactate 1,100mL combined with ultrafiltration (group T). Bleeding volume, transfusions, fluid balance, coagulation, and hematology parameters were determined until 48h in the post‐operative period. RESULTS: There was a reduction of postoperative bleeding in group T, 1,165±789mL vs 992±662mL (P=.17), and red blood cell concentrate transfusions, 694±843mL vs 413±605mL (P=.03). Intra‐operative and post‐operative fluid balance was significantly less positive in group T, with an overall balance of 2,292±2,152mL vs 5,388±2,834mL (P<.001).

The objective was to determine the effect of MTP implementation on outcomes of injured children. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison of injured children before and after MTP implementation for children less than 18 years old who presented in 2005 to 2014 and received red blood cells (RBCs) within 24 hours of arrival. Children were divided into groups based on pre-/post-MTP implementation and subgrouped based on receipt of massive transfusion (≥40 mL/kg RBCs or ≥80 mL/kg total blood products at 24 hr from arrival).

RESULTS: A total of 11,995 children presented for trauma care over 9 years; 235 received RBCs. A total of 120 were in the pre-MTP group and 115 in the post-MTP, of whom 26 and 17 received massive transfusion in the pre- and post-MTP groups, respectively; 11 had MTP activations.

Patients undergoing liver transplantation receive large amounts of cellular and plasma-containing blood components, but it is presently unclear which blood components are associated with these postoperative complications. A retrospective cohort study of 525 consecutive liver transplant patients revealed a perioperative TRALI rate of 1.3% (7/525, 95% confidence interval = 0.6%-2.7%), which was associated with increases in the hospital mortality rate [28.6% (2/7) versus 2.9% (15/518), P = 0.02] and the intensive care unit length of stay [2 (1-11 days) versus 0 days (0-2 days), P = 0.03].

CASE: A 44-year-old gravida 4 with history of two full-term vaginal deliveries presented at 40 and 2/7 weeks of gestation with premature rupture of membranes and delivered vaginally a viable female infant complicated by a postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. During a manual uterine sweep for suspected retained products of conception, a submucosal leiomyoma was incidentally extracted. Uterine hemorrhage immediately ensued, requiring vasopressors, blood transfusion, and intensive care unit admission. Hemostasis was ultimately achieved with placement of a Bakri balloon. CONCLUSION: This case reaffirms the association of large (greater than five centimeters) submucosal leiomyoma with severe postpartum hemorrhage.

A 23-day-old male with sHTG was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for plasmapheresis being at high risk for acute pancreatitis. Given the potential hazard of an extracorporeal technique in a very young infant, we decided to perform an exchange transfusion (ET), a procedure widely used by neonatologists and less invasive than plasmapheresis. ET led to a dramatic reduction in plasma triglyceride level, from 93.2 to 3.8 mmol/L at the end of the procedure, without adverse events. The subsequent administration of a special formula low in fat and high in medium-chain triglycerides was effective in keeping fasting plasma triglyceride level below 5.6 mmol/L during the first 5 months of life. The sequence of LPL gene revealed that the patient was apparently homozygous for a novel nucleotide deletion (c.840delG) in exon 6 leading to a premature termination codon (p.N281Mfs*23). However, family studies revealed that while the patient's mother was heterozygous for this mutation, the father was heterozygous for a novel deletion eliminating the whole LPL gene. The patient therefore turned out to be a compound heterozygous for two LPL gene mutations predicted to abolish LPL activity. This is the first case of sHTG treated with ET in a neonate reported in the literature.

Intensivists must be familiar with contemporary literature to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for each patient. RECENT FINDINGS: A balanced ratio of red-blood cells to plasma and platelets is associated with improved mortality and has therefore become the standard of care for resuscitation. There is a dose-dependent relationship between units of product transfused and infections. Liquid and freeze-dried plasma are alternatives to fresh frozen plasma that can be administered immediately and may improve coagulation parameters more rapidly, though higher quality research is needed. Trauma induced coagulopathy can occur despite a balanced transfusion, and administration of prothrombin complex concentrate and cryoprecipitate may have a role in preventing this. In addition to balanced ratios, viscoelastic guidance is being increasingly utilized to individualize component transfusion. Alternatively, whole blood can be used, which has become the standard in military practice and is gaining popularity at civilian centers.

Improved resuscitation strategy has been one of the most important contemporary advancements in trauma care and continues to be a key area of clinical research.",2022,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000992,"{""pmid"": 36226706, ""electronic_issn"": ""1531-7072"", ""linking_issn"": ""1070-5295"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9504454"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Review""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Component Transfusion"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Shock, Hemorrhagic"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Shock, Hemorrhagic"", ""qualifier"": ""complications"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Resuscitation"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Coagulation Disorders"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""complications"", ""major"": true}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2022 Dec 1"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2022-10-14"", ""electronic"": ""2022-10-13""}}"

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study comparing the incidence of IVH in very premature infants with thrombocytopaenia (platelet count <150×10(9)/l) admitted between 2007 and 2008 to two neonatal intensive care unit in The Netherlands. The restrictive platelet-transfusion unit (N=353 infants <32 weeks gestation) transfused only in case of active haemorrhage and a platelet count <50×10(9)/l. The liberal-transfusion unit (N=326 infants <32 weeks gestation) transfused according to predefined platelet count thresholds. Primary outcome was the incidence and severity of IVH in infants with thrombocytopaenia in both units. RESULTS: The number of infants with thrombocytopaenia that received a platelet transfusion was significantly lower in the restrictive-transfusion unit compared with the liberal-transfusion unit, 15% (21/145) versus 31% (41/141), (p<0.001). The incidence of IVH in infants with thrombocytopaenia in the restrictive-transfusion and liberal-transfusion units was 30% (44/145) and 29% (41/141), respectively (p=0.81). The incidence of severe IVH (grade 3 or 4) in the restrictive-transfusion and liberal-transfusion units was 8% (12/145) and 11% (16/141), respectively (p=0.38).

Therefore, we sought to determine the risk for mortality in PTPs receiving an MT of ≥ 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) within 24 h. We compared PRBC: plasma ratio of > 2:1 (Unbalanced Ratios, UR) versus ≤ 2:1 (Balanced Ratios, BR), hypothesizing decreased risk of mortality with BR. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried (2014-2016) for PTPs receiving a MT. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine risk of mortality. RESULTS: From 239 PTPs receiving an MT, 98 (41%) received an UR, whereas 141 (59%) received a BR. The median ratios, respectively, were 2.7:1 and 1.2:1. Compared to BR patients, UR patients had no differences in injury severity score (ISS), hypotension on admission, and intensive care unit stay (all p > 0.05). The mortality rates for BR and UR were similar (46.1% vs. 52.0%, p = 0.366). Controlling for age, ISS, and severe head injury, UR demonstrated similar risk of mortality compared to BR (p = 0.276). Additionally, ≥ 4:1 ratio versus ≤ 2:1 showed no difference in associated risk of mortality (p = 0.489). CONCLUSION: In contrast to adult studies, this study demonstrated that MT ratios of > 2:1 and even ≥ 4:1 were associated with similar mortality compared to BR for PTPs. These results suggest pediatric MT resuscitation may not require strict BR as has been shown beneficial in adult trauma patients. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the optimal ratio for PTP MT resuscitation.

In addition to the risks of sepsis, ABO blood group mismatch, and other complications associated with transfusion, the intensivist needs to be familiar with alternative therapies to minimize transfusion. Recent findings: Transfusion-related acute lung injury and immunosuppression are two newly recognized complications in transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury can lead to respiratory failure in an acute respiratory distress syndrome-like picture, often necessitating intubation and critical care services. Immunosuppression following transfusion has been linked to cytokine and complement activation. Recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO, Epogen, Procrit), by maximizing red cell counts, and aprotinin (Trasylol), by inhibiting fibrinolysis, are two old drugs being used with increasing frequency in a new setting: the intensive care unit. A new component therapy, recombinant factor Vila (rFVIIa, NovoSeven), assists in turning on the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Summary: Recognizing early signs of transfusion-related acute lung injury may aid in the treatment and reporting of this entity. Realizing the mechanism and severity of immunosuppression associated with transfusion may alter transfusion triggers in the intensive care unit. rHuEPO and aprotinin are now being used with increasing frequency to increase red cell counts and minimize the need for transfusion. Recombinant factor FVIIa targets coagulation cascade activation which helps to reduce the number of units of blood products transfused in the actively bleeding patient. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2006/04//,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 250 Waterloo Road, SE1 8RD",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/699237103?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""699237103;

AIMS: To assess the impact of anticoagulant choice (LMWV vs UFH) on bleeding, the need for blood transfusion and 3-year clinical outcomes in AMI patients from the FAST-MI registry. METHODS: FAST-MI was a nationwide registry compiled in France over 1 month in 2005, which included consecutive AMI patients admitted to an intensive care unit less than 48 hours from symptom onset in 223 participating centres. RESULTS: A total of 2854 patients treated with heparins were included. The risks of major bleeding or transfusion (3.0% vs 7.0%) and in-hospital death (3.2% vs 9.2%) were lower with LMWH compared with UFH, a difference that persisted after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.76 and OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.76, respectively). Three-year survival, and stroke and reinfarction-free survival risks were also higher with LMWH compared with UFH (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.87 and HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85, respectively). In two cohorts of patients matched on propensity score for receiving LMWH and with similar baseline characteristics (834 patients per group), major bleeding and transfusion rates were lower while the 3-year survival rate was signiﬁcantly higher in patients receiving LMWH.

The objectives of the present study were to compare mortality and morbidity in non-septic critically ill patients who were given low-grade RBC transfusions at haemoglobin level > 70 g L–1 with patients without RBC-transfusions any of the first 5 days in intensive care. Methods: Adult patients admitted to a general intensive care unit between 2007 and 2018 at a university hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients who received > 2 units RBC transfusion per day during the first 5 days after admisasion, with pre-transfusion haemoglobin level < 70 g L–1 or with severe sepsis or septic shock, were excluded. Results: In total, 9491 admissions were recorded during the study period. Propensity score matching resulted in 2 well matched groups with 674 unique patients in each. Median pre-transfusion haemoglobin was 98 g L–1 (interquartile range 91–107 g L–1). Mortality was higher in the RBC group with an absolute risk increase for death at 180 days of 5.9% (95% CI: 3.6–8.3; P< 0.001). Low-grade RBC-transfusion was also associated with renal, circulatory, and respiratory failure as well as a higher SOFA-max score. Sensitivity analyses suggested that disease trajectories during the exposure time did not significantly differ between the groups.

The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed as a marker of systemic inflammation in major trauma patients that is associated with in-hospital mortality. The aim of this systematic review is to compile all the best evidence available to determine the prognostic capabilities of the NLR in trauma and to assess the NLR as a predictor of mortality in adult major trauma patients. Additionally, comparing NLR and hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, mechanical ventilation and transfusion requirements. Methods: We conducted a search of online information sources to identify manuscripts observing the NLR in adult major trauma patients. Outcomes of interest include mortality as defined by the author, hospital LOS, ICU LOS, mechanical ventilation and transfusion requirements. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis if there were sufficient manuscripts included. Results: Eight studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Trials were of good methodological quality. Substantial heterogeneity present between the studies prevented a meta-analysis from being conducted. Overall, five studies demonstrated the NLR as a significantly predictive marker of mortality. NLR was observed to be significantly associated with increased ICU LOS and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Mixed results were observed between NLR and hospital LOS and transfusion requirements. Conclusions: A potential association between NLR and mortality, ICU LOS and duration of mechanical ventilation has been reported.

BACKGROUND: For decades, whole blood (WB) was the primary product for resuscitating patients in hemorrhagic shock. After dramatic advances in blood banking in the 1970s, blood donor centers began supplying hospitals with individual components [red blood cell (RBC), plasma, platelets] and removed WB as an available product. However, no studies of efficacy or hemostatic potential in trauma patients were performed before doing so. METHODS: Single-center, randomized trial of severely injured patients predicted to large transfusion volume. Pregnant patients, prisoners, those younger than 18 years or with more than 20% total body surface area burns (TBSA) burns were excluded. Patients were randomized to mWB (1 U mWB) or COMP therapy (1 U RBC+ 1 U plasma) immediately on arrival. Each group also received 1 U platelets (apheresis or prepooled random donor) for every 6 U of mWB or 6 U of RBC + 6 U plasma. The study was performed under the Exception From Informed Consent (Food and Drug Administration 21 code of federal regulations [CFR] 50.24). Primary outcome was 24-hour transfusion volumes. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were randomized (55 mWB, 52 COMP therapy) over 14 months. There were no differences in demographics, arrival vitals or laboratory values, injury severity, or mechanism. Transfusions were similar between groups (intent-to-treat analysis). However, when excluding patients with severe brain injury (sensitivity analysis), WB group received less 24-hour RBC (median 3 vs 6, P = 0.02), plasma (4 vs 6, P = 0.02), platelets (0 vs 3, P = 0.09), and total products (11 vs 16, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with COMP therapy, WB did not reduce transfusion volumes in severely injured patients predicted to receive massive transfusion. However, in the sensitivity analysis (patients without severe brain injuries), use of mWB significantly reduced transfusion volumes, achieving the prespecified endpoint of this initial pilot study.",2013,United States,https://doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182a4ffa0,"{""pmid"": 23979267, ""electronic_issn"": ""1528-1140"", ""linking_issn"": ""0003-4932"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""0372354"", ""publication_types"": [""Comparative Study"", ""Journal Article"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Adolescent"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Adult"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Aged, 80 and over"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Component Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""statistics & numerical data"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Intention to Treat Analysis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pilot Projects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Resuscitation"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Shock, Hemorrhagic"", ""qualifier"": ""etiology"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Shock, Hemorrhagic"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Trauma Severity Indices"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Treatment Outcome"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""complications"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Wounds and Injuries"", ""qualifier"": ""therapy"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Young Adult"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2013 Oct"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2013-08-28""}}"

Methods: Electronic medical records of 90,785 patients who underwent non-cardiac- and nonneurosurgery at the *** General Hospital from January 1, 2012 to October 31, 2016, were subject to secondary retrospective analysis. The principal exposure was regional versus general anesthesia. Outcome measures were death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and blood transfusion requirement within 30 days after surgery. Propensity-score matching was used to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. Results: We identified 90,785 patients, of whom 76,442 received regional anesthesia and 14,343 received general anesthesia. A total of 11,351 patients in the general anesthesia group had propensity scores similar to those of patients who received regional anesthesia and were included in the analyses. In the propensity-score matched cohort, the postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 0.75% (n = 85) in the regional anesthesia group (Odds Ratio, 0.567; 95% CI, 0.434 to 0.741; P = 0.00003) compared with 1.31% (n = 149) in the general anesthesia group.

The first aim of this study was to assess the 90-day survival of LT recipients according to massive intraoperative transfusion (MIOT). Methods: This prospective, observational, single-centre study analysed the intraoperative transfusion (IOT) of all consecutive LT recipients between January 2016 and February 2019. MIOT was defined as transfusion of 5 RBC units or more. The results are presented as the median [IQR] and absolute numbers (proportions) and were analysed using χ2, Fisher, and Mann–Whitney tests (p < 0.05 as significance). Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for MIOT, 90-day and one-year mortality and grade 3 PGD at day 3. Ninety-day and one-year survivals were studied (Kaplan–Meier curves, log rank test). The Paris-North-Hospitals Institutional Review Board approved the study. Results: Overall, 147 patients were included in the analysis, 27 (18%) of them received MIOT. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors of MIOT included preoperative ECMO support (p = 0.017), and bilateral LT (p = 0.023). The SOFA score on ICU admission after LT was higher in cases with MIOT (p < 0.001). MIOT was an independent risk factor for 90-days and one-year mortality (p = 0.002 and 0.008 respectively). The number of RBCs unit transfused during surgery was an independent risk factor for grade 3 PGD at day 3 (OR 1.14, 95% CI [1.00–1.29], p = 0.040). Conclusion: Increased preoperative severity of recipients predicts MIOT.

Anemia normally results in increased circulating erythropoietin concentrations; however, critical illness has been associated with a blunted erythropoietin response. Treatment with erythropoietin decreases the need for red blood cell transfusion in several disease states. We hypothesized that critically ill children with bronchiolitis and anemia would have a circulating erythropoietin deficiency and that treatment with exogenous erythropoietin would increase reticulocyte count and hematocrit and reduce red blood cell transfusion requirements. DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Children's hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill children with bronchiolitis, anemia, and respiratory failure. Anemia was defined as a hematocrit >2 SD below normal for age. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of two groups. In the erythropoietin group, patients received daily intravenous erythropoietin. In the control group, patients received daily intravenous placebo. Both groups were treated with elemental iron. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood for complete blood count, reticulocyte count, and ferritin and erythropoietin concentration was obtained at admission and discharge. Red blood cell transfusions were administered to patients with a persistent oxygen requirement and a hematocrit of <25%. Outcome variables included number of red blood cell transfusions, change in reticulocyte count, ferritin values, and circulating erythropoietin values between groups. Forty-four patients completed the study (mean 3.1 +/- 0.6 months), with a baseline hematocrit of 27.6 +/- 0.5%, ventilator days of 8.2 +/- 0.6, and pediatric intensive care unit length of stay of 9.8 +/- 0.6 days. There were no significant baseline demographic differences between the control and erythropoietin groups. Ten of 22 (45%) children in the erythropoietin group required red blood cell transfusion compared with 11 of 22 (50%) in the control group (p = nonsignificant). The increase in reticulocyte count was greater in the erythropoietin group compared with the control group (2.1 +/- 0.3% to 4.7 +/- 0.7%, p = .003 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3% to 2.7 +/- 0.5%, p = nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a favorable reticulocyte and circulating erythropoietin response, red blood cell transfusion requirements were not significantly diminished by erythropoietin treatment in children with bronchiolitis and respiratory failure.

Coagulopathies are not uncommon in cardiac surgical patients, but the time lapse for reporting conventional laboratory results has been highlighted as an obstacle to the appropriate use of blood products. Accordingly, much interest has arisen in rapid near-patient testing of coagulation and, in January 2002, a thromboelastometer (ROTEM, Pentapharm, Germany) was purchased for our unit.

Previous studies are ambiguous with regard to bleeding, transfusion, and perioperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of perioperative bleeding, transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in cardiac surgical patients taking SSRI/SNRIs compared with propensity-matched controls. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at our institution between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014, were eligible for study inclusion. Patients taking SSRI/SNRI medications at the time of surgery were identified and compared against all other patients not taking SSRI/SNRI medications to produce well-matched groups via propensity score analysis. Patients taking SSRI/SNRI medications were matched in a 1:1 ratio to control patients not taking these medications based on an internally estimated propensity score. Primary outcomes included perioperative blood transfusion, chest tube output, and reoperation for bleeding. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications (renal failure, stroke or transient ischemic accident, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and perioperative myocardial infarction), intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1417 pairs of SSRI/SNRI patients and matched controls were retained for analysis. Between SSRI/SNRI patients and matched controls, there was no significant difference in postoperative chest tube output (median, 750.0 vs 750.0 mL; P = .860) or reoperation for bleeding (2.8% vs 2.5%; P = .892). Perioperative transfusion rates across all time points and blood product type were not significantly different between groups, with the overall perioperative transfusion rate for SSRI/SNRI patients 66.5% vs 64.9% for matched controls (P = .697). Patients in the SSRI/SNRI group had a higher rate of prolonged mechanical ventilation (13.1% vs 8.6%; P = .002), longer ICU LOS (median, 25.5 vs 23.8 hours; P < .001), and longer hospital LOS (median, 6.0 vs 5.0 days; P < .001). Remaining mortality and outcome data were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: SSRI/SNRI use was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding or transfusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. While there was prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased ICU/hospital LOS in the SSRI/SNRI group, it is unclear that this finding is the result of such medications or rather associated with the underlying psychiatric condition for which they are prescribed. The results of this study suggest that perioperative interruption of SSRI/SNRIs to reduce the risk of perioperative bleeding and transfusion is unwarranted and may risk destabilization of patients' psychiatric condition.",2018,United States,https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000002668,"{""pmid"": 29210786, ""electronic_issn"": ""1526-7598"", ""linking_issn"": ""0003-2999"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""1310650"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Loss, Surgical"", ""qualifier"": ""prevention & control"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""trends"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""qualifier"": ""trends"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Complications"", ""qualifier"": ""chemically induced"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Complications"", ""qualifier"": ""diagnosis"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Postoperative Complications"", ""qualifier"": ""epidemiology"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Retrospective Studies"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"", ""qualifier"": ""administration & dosage"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors"", ""qualifier"": ""administration & dosage"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors"", ""qualifier"": ""adverse effects"", ""major"": false}], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2018 Jun"", ""dates"": {""published"": ""2017-12-07""}}"

Moderate and severe anemia in pregnancy is defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <10 g/dl and Hb < 7 g/dl, respectively. We aimed to characterize the association of maternal anemia with maternal, neonatal, and placental outcomes in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 352 pregnant women at a tertiary academic Ugandan hospital. One hundred and seventy-six (50%) of women were living with HIV. Hemoglobin was measured in labor, and placentas were collected postpartum. Maternal outcomes included mode of delivery, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, intensive care unit admission, and maternal mortality. Neonatal outcomes included gestational age at delivery, birthweight, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. Placental descriptors included weight and thickness. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Hemoglobin < 10 g/dl, was present in 17/352 (5%) of women. Significantly more women with moderate or severe anemia were HIV-infected: 14/17 (82%) versus 162/335 (48%) (p = .006). Blood transfusions (2/17, 12% versus 5/335, 2%, p = .04) and neonatal deaths (2/17, 12% versus 9/335, 3%, p = .01) were more common in the anemia group. Placental thickness was lower in the anemia group (1.4 cm versus 1.7 cm, p = .04).

The objective of this analysis was to compare the maternal outcomes associated with PPH before and after introduction of DSE. The co-primary outcomes were the rate of PPH or of any transfusion; the secondary outcomes included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), transfusion ≥ 4 units PRBC, hysterectomy or maternal death. Study Design: Electronic databases (Medline OVID, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus) were queried in March, 2021 for this systematic review and meta-analysis (SR MA). Non-randomized and randomized studies that reported on M&amp;M associated with PPH in cohorts unexposed and exposed to DSE were included. Study effects were combined by Bayesian meta-analysis and reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% credible intervals (Cr). Results: Of the 112 studies identified, 17 (13 Non-US and 4 from US) were included in the analysis, totaling 330,341 deliveries. Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, 76% (13/17) of the articles were categorized as being of poor quality. Significant heterogeneity was noted in both the definition of PPH and on the type of intervention used. The rate of PPH (7.7% vs. 8.1%; RR 1.09, 95% Cr 0.86-0.1.36) and the likelihood of transfusion (1.5% vs. 2.6%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.12) were similar before and after DSE. The rate of PPH and transfusion did not differ significantly irrespective of where the study was conducted (Fig 1A & B). Admission to ICU (RR 0.78, 95% Cr 0.48-1.16), transfusion of ≥ 4 units PRBC (RR 0.85, 95% Cr 0.50-1.52), hysterectomy (RR 0.92, 95% Cr 0.58-1.43), and maternal death (RR 0.62. 95% Cr 0.33 – 1.05) were similar in pre- and post-intervention periods (Table). Conclusion: Tremendous resources are currently being deployed to implement DSE to reduce PPH in the US. The current evidence is of poor quality, high heterogeneity, with a majority conducted outside the US. Mandates requiring DSE are not supported by the available evidence.

Then, we aim to compare the mortality of platelet transfusion and non-transfusion in patients with different degrees of thrombocytopenia. METHODS: We identified all thrombocytopenic patients in intensive care unit by using platelet-specific values and then extracted electronic health records from our Hospital Information System. Data were statistically analyzed with t test, chi-square test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: We found that infections (32.7%) were the most frequent cause associated with thrombocytopenia, followed by sepsis shock (3.93%) and blood loss (2.99%). Meanwhile, antifungals (p = 0.002) and bacterial infection (p = 0.037) were associated with severe and extremely severe thrombocytopenia. Finally, we found that the mortality of platelet transfusion and non-transfusion in patients was statistically significant for patients with platelet counts between 30 and 49/nL (χ(2) = 9.719, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Infection and sepsis emerged as two primary factors associated with thrombocytopenia in intensive care unit.

To analyze the frequency and risk factors for hypothermia and its effects on patient outcome, we prospectively studied 94 intubated injured patients at a regional trauma center during a 16-month period. Esophageal temperature probes were placed in the field or ER and core temperatures (T) were followed for 24 hours or until rewarming. Patients were designated as normothermic (>36°C), mildly hypothermic (34°C-36°C) or severely hypothermic (<34°C) based on initial T. The risk factors for hypothermia evaluated included age, severity and location of injuries, blood alcohol level, blood transfusion requirements, and time spent in the field, ER, or OR. The average initial T was 35°C, with no seasonal variation. Injury severity and survival correlated with severe hypothermia. Normothermic patients had an average ISS of 28 with a 78% survival. Severely hypothermic patients had an average ISS of 36 with a 41% survival (p < 0.05). Patient age strongly correlated with outcome although there was no relationship between age and initial temperature. Sixty-two per cent of patients tested were positive for blood alcohol, and one half were legally intoxicated (BAC > 100 mg%). However, no consistent correlation was found between alcohol intoxication and initial temperature or patient survival. Blood transfusion requirements paralleled injury severity and patients receiving greater than 10 unit transfusions had significantly lower core temperature (p < 0.05). The average temperature change was positive in the ER, OR, and ICU with time to rewarming correlating with the aggressiveness of warming measures. We conclude that: 1) The majority of severely injured patients are hypothermic. 2) Awareness of potential detrimental effects of hypothermia resulted in an average positive T change during initial care. 3) Rapid prehospital care and transport may offset the effects of age and alcohol intoxication on temperature regulation. 4) Severe hypothermia is common among severely injured patients.",1987,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 351 West Camden Street, MD 21201-2436",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/684774193?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""684774193; 17162676"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Embase"", ""MEDLINE"", ""9:Surgery"", ""cardiovascular system"", ""hypothermia"", ""major clinical study"", ""therapy"", ""diagnosis"", ""injury"", ""monitoring"", ""human"", ""risk factor""], ""issn"": ""00225282"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Surgery, University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98104, United States , Department of Surgery, University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98104, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 1987-12-31"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-31"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-02"", ""CODEN - JOTRA""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Trauma&rft.atitle=Incidence+and+effect+of+hypothermia+in+seriously+injured+patients&rft.au=Luna%2C+G.K.&rft.aulast=Luna&rft.aufirst=G.K.&rft.date=1987-01-01&rft.volume=27&rft.issue=9&rft.spage=1014&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Trauma&rft.issn=00225282&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""1987""}"

To describe the characteristics of infections occurring in the immediate postoperative period of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in children in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and the associated risk factors. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Multidisciplinary 16-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary university hospital. Patients. One hundred and thirty-three pediatric patients (range 6 M to 22 yr) who underwent 176 liver transplantations and were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for at least 48 h. Results. A total of 180 infectious episodes (IE) occurred in 78 (59%) patients who underwent 96 (54.5%) liver transplantations (1.35 IE/patient; 1.02 IE/transplantation). The mean stay was 15.4 ± 1.1 d (mean ± SD) and 22 patients died in the pediatric intensive care unit. One hundred and thiryt-one IE (72.8%) were bacterial, 31 (17.2%) fungal, and 14 (7.8%) mixed bacterial and fungal. 39% of the IE appeared in the first postoperative week and 27% in the second postoperative week. The most common sites of infection were abdomen (48.3%) and blood stream (26.1%). Bacteria, alone or with fungi, were present in 145 IE (1.1 IE/patient). Gram-positive aerobic bacteria (63%) predominated over gram-negative bacteria (54%) and fungi. Fungi were present in 45 IE; 53.4% of the infections occurred in lung (73% yeasts). The risk factors for infection that were identified were related with younger age, lower body weight, longer cold ischemia time, partial graft, and the volume of packed red blood cell transfusions. Infected patients had more postoperative complications and longer stay in the PICU (21 ± 16 vs. 8 ± 6 d), but no increase in mortality. The risk of infection increased 2.38 times with partial grafts and 1.1 times with each intraoperative transfusion of 20 ml/kg of packed red blood cells (RBC). Conclusions. Infection in the immediate postoperative period of pediatric OLT was related with a high morbidity but was not related significantly with increased mortality. The main risk factors for infection in the postoperative period of OLT were related essentially with small recipient size and the inherent complexity of the operation.

Our study aims to explore the epidemiology and risk factors affecting outcomes of ARDS patients and provide a theoretical basis for patients’ prognosis. Methods: This retrospective study included 207 ARDS patients admitted to the general intensive care unit (ICU) in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from Jan 1st, 2016 to Jan 1st, 2017. The criteria were defined according to the Berlin Definition, and clinical data were collected from the medical record system. The mortality rate and duration of mechanical ventilation were compared in ARDS patients. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was applied to screen clinically accessible risk factors for survival and duration of mechanical ventilation. Results: The total mortality in ARDS patients was 39.13% (81/207) compared to 13.57% (151/1,113) in the whole ICU population. The period prevalence of mild, moderate and severe ARDS was 39.61% (82/207), 37.20% (77/207) and 23.19% (48/207), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR 3.4316; 95% CI: 1.3130–8.9686; P=0.0119), number of organ failure (OR 3.4928; 95% CI: 1.9775–6.1693; P<0.0001), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (OR 5.1049; 95% CI: 1.8317–14.2274; P=0.0018), driving pressure (OR 6.0017; 95% CI: 2.1746–16.5641; P=0.0005) and lactate level (OR 4.0754; 95% CI: 1.6114–10.3068; P=0.0030) were influence factors for survival; severity of ARDS (OR 1.6715; 95% CI: 1.0307–2.7108; P=0.0373), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (OR 7.3746; 95% CI: 2.9799–18.2505; P<0.0001) and transfusion history (OR 2.2822; 95% CI: 1.0462–4.9783; P=0.0381) were influence factors for duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Higher APACHE II score, more organ failures, lower MAP, higher driving pressure and higher lactate level are risk factors for survival. Higher severity of ARDS, VAP and transfusion history are risk factors for prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Application of these parameters would enable intensivists to treat their patients more precisely and comprehensively.",2019,AME Publishing Company,['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/2222711720?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""2222711720; 627528321"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Article"", ""keywords"": [""Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"", ""Duration of mechanical ventilation"", ""Risk factor"", ""Survival"", ""lactic acid"", ""113-21-3"", ""50-21-5"", ""Embase"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""29:Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry"", ""15:Chest Diseases, Thoracic Surgery and Tuberculosis"", ""major clinical study"", ""Article"", ""lactic acid -- endogenous compound"", ""treatment duration"", ""lactate blood level"", ""female"", ""disease severity"", ""human"", ""blood transfusion"", ""adult respiratory distress syndrome -- therapy"", ""ventilator associated pneumonia"", ""artificial ventilation"", ""mean arterial pressure"", ""survival"", ""aged"", ""adult respiratory distress syndrome -- etiology"", ""prognosis"", ""risk factor"", ""mortality rate"", ""controlled study"", ""clinical outcome"", ""adult"", ""APACHE"", ""male"", ""retrospective study""], ""doi"": ""http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.02.84"", ""issn"": ""20721439"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China , Department of Critical Care Medicine, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, 150081, China drkaijiang@163.com, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China, Yu, Kaijiang, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, No. 150 Haping Road, Harbin, 150081, China"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2019-05-15"", ""Date revised - 2019-05-16"", ""Number of references - 44"", ""Last updated - 2019-05-16""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Thoracic+Disease&rft.atitle=Risk+factors+for+outcomes+of+acute+respiratory+distress+syndrome+patients%3A+A+retrospective+study&rft.au=Dai%2C+Qingqing&rft.aulast=Dai&rft.aufirst=Qingqing&rft.date=2019-01-01&rft.volume=11&rft.issue=3&rft.spage=673&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Journal+of+Thoracic+Disease&rft.issn=20721439&rft_id=info:doi/10.21037%2Fjtd.2019.02.84"", ""date"": ""2019""}"

Our objective was to characterize and define the clinical factors that influence PRBC transfusion practice. Design: Prospective study using a validated 11 item questionnaire administered to 43 physicians. Setting: University of Puerto Rico, Neurosurgery Department. Patient and participants: Population included attending physicians (AP) and residents (R). Interventions: Questions included decision making logistics and therapeutic elements: general demographics, reasons for transfusion, quantity given, transfusion threshold, and the expected appropriate hemoglobin (Hb) level for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), with coronary artery diseases (CAD) or without CAD. Measurements and results: Fifty three percent neurosurgeons responded the questionnaire. 65% were AP and 33% were R. 43% of AP vs 25% of R transfused to increase oxygen delivery, 50% of R vs 38% of AP transfused to avoid ischemic injury, 50% of both AP and R considered that age and disease severity may interfere with adaptation of anemia, therefore needing transfusion, and 50% of AP vs 38% of R to improved safety margin anticipating further blood loss. Threshold for transfusion was a Hb level of 8-10 g/dL (36%) or <7 g/dL (41%). 77% of AP and 63% of R thought the appropriate level of Hb in SAH was 10-12 g/dL. 65% of AP thought that in TBI Hb level should be between 10-12 g/dL and 38% of R answered 8-12 g/dL. 63% of R thought that the appropriate Hb for a post-op patient with CAD was between 10-12 g/dL and 46% of AP answered 10-12 g/dL or >12 g/dL. The appropriate Hb for post-op patient without CAD was 10-12 g/dL, and there was no significant difference between AP and R.

The Patient Blood Management Program is an integrated and global strategy to provide patient care that aims to assess and address, when possible, the etiology of blood abnormalities rather than transfuse without treating the underlying cause. We aimed to describe the factors that are associated with the clinical decision to transfuse polytraumatized patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Method: We performed a cross sectional multicenter study of patients admitted to ICUs for trauma in 14 Spanish hospitals from September 2020 to December 2021. Results: A total of 69 patients were treated in the emergency room due to polytrauma, 46% of them were considered serious in the initial triage. Thirty were caused by a fall from considerable height (43.47%), followed by 39 patients admitted due to trac accidents (56.52%). The location of the trauma was mainly cranioencephalic, followed by thoracic trauma. Of the 69 patients, 25 received a blood transfusion during their ICU stay (36.23%). Discussion: No significant differences were observed between transfused and non-transfused patients, except for the severity scales, where transfused patients have a higher score on all the scales assessed in the ICU except for the Revised Trauma Score. As we can see, the incidence of kidney failure was also different between the groups analyzed, reaching 44.00% in transfused patients and 13.64% in the group of patients without blood transfusion, p = 0.005. In this sense, 92.00% of the transfusions performed were inadequate according to the criteria of Hb in blood prior to the decision to transfuse (Hb < 9).

We explored maternal morbidity in the setting of NRFS. Our hypothesis is that delivery of a live newborn with NRFS is associated with significant maternal morbidity. Design, Participants, Setting, and Methods: A large retrospective cohort study of 27,886 women who delivered between January 2013 and December 2016 in a single health system was studied. Inclusion criteria included (1) women over the age of 18 at the time of admission; (2) singleton pregnancy; (3) live birth; and (4) gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks at the time of admission. NRFS was defined as umbilical cord pH less than or equal to 7.00, fetal bradycardia, late decelerations, and/or umbilical artery base excess ≤-12. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression and propensity score analyses were performed, and propensity score adjusted odds ratios (AORPS) were derived. p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Primary outcomes are maternal blood transfusion, maternal readmission, maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cesarean delivery in relation to umbilical artery pH, fetal bradycardia, and late decelerations. RESULTS: Umbilical artery pH less than or equal to 7 was associated with maternal blood transfusion (AORPS 6.83 [95% CI 2.22-21.0, p &lt; 0.001]), maternal readmission (AORPS 12.6 [95% CI 2.26-69.8, p = 0.0039]), and cesarean delivery (AORPS 5.76 [95% CI 3.63-9.15, p &lt; 0.0001]). Fetal bradycardia was associated with transfusion (AORPS 2.13 [95% CI 1.26-3.59, p &lt; 0.005]) and maternal ICU admission (AORPS 3.22 [95% CI 1.23-8.46, p &lt; 0.017]). Late decelerations were associated with cesarean delivery (AORPS 1.65 [95% CI 1.55-1.76, p &lt; 0.0001]), clinical chorioamnionitis (AORPS 2.88 [95% CI 2.46-3.37, p &lt; 0.0001]), and maternal need for antibiotics (AORPS 1.89 [95% CI 1.66-2.15, p &lt; 0.0001]). Umbilical artery base excess less than or equal to -12 was associated with readmission (AORPS 6.71 [95% CI 2.22-20.3, p = 0.0007]), clinical chorioamnionitis (AORPS 1.89 [95% CI 1.24-2.89, p = 0.0031]), and maternal need for antibiotics (AORPS 1.53 [95% CI 1.03-2.26, p = 0.0344]). LIMITATIONS: The retrospective design contributes to potential bias compared to the prospective design. However, by utilizing multivariate logistic regression analysis with a propensity score method, specifically inverse probability of treatment weighting, we attempted to minimize the impact of confounding variables. Additionally, only a portion of the data set had quantitative blood losses recorded, while the remainder had estimated blood losses. CONCLUSION: NRFS is associated with significant maternal complications, in the form of increased need for blood transfusions, ICU admissions, and increased infection and readmission rates.

Uncontrolled haemorrhage is the main avoidable cause of death among severely injured individuals. Management of trauma patients is the greatest challenge in trauma emergency care, and its proper diagnosis and early management of bleeding trauma patients, including blood transfusion, are critical for patient outcomes. AIM: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of transfusion practices in severe trauma patients admitted into Spanish Intensive Care Units. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study in 111 Intensive Care Units across Spain. Adult patients with moderate or severe trauma were eligible. Distribution of frequencies was used for qualitative variables and the mean, with its 95% CI, for quantitative variables. Transfusion programmes, the number of transfusions performed, and the blood component transfused were recorded. Demographic variables, mortality rate, hospital stay, SOFA-score and haemoglobin levels were also gathered. RESULTS: We obtained results from 109 patients. The most transfused blood component was packet red blood cells with 93.8% of total transfusions versus 43.8% of platelets and 37.5% of fresh plasma. The main criteria for transfusion were analytical criteria (43.75%), and acute anaemia with shock (18.75%) and without haemodynamic impact (18.75%). CONCLUSION: Clinical practice shows a ratio of red blood cells, platelets, and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) of 2:1:1. It is necessary to implement Massive Transfusion Protocols as they appear to improve outcomes. Our study suggests that transfusion of RBC, platelets and FFP in a 2:1:1 ratio could be beneficial for trauma patients.",2022,Switzerland,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11123532,"{""pmid"": 35743602, ""electronic_issn"": ""2077-0383"", ""print_issn"": ""2077-0383"", ""linking_issn"": ""2077-0383"", ""nlm_status"": ""PubMed-not-MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""101606588"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article""], ""keywords"": [""haemoglobin"", ""management"", ""transfusion""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""epublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2022 Jun 20"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2022-06-09"", ""accepted"": ""2022-06-16"", ""published"": ""2022-06-25"", ""revised"": ""2022-06-16"", ""electronic"": ""2022-06-20""}}"

DESIGN: Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery (TRICS) III was a multicenter, international, open-label randomized controlled trial of two commonly used transfusion strategies in patients having cardiac surgery using a noninferiority trial design (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02042898). SETTING: Eligible patients were randomized prior to surgery in a 1:1 ratio. PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants were 18 years or older undergoing planned cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with a preoperative European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE I) of 6 or more. INTERVENTIONS: Five thousand patients; those allocated to a restrictive transfusion group received a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration (Hb) was less than 7.5 g/dL intraoperatively and/or postoperatively. Patients allocated to a liberal transfusion strategy received RBC transfusion if the Hb was less than 9.5 g/dL intraoperatively or postoperatively in the intensive care unit or less than 8.5 g/dL on the ward. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new onset renal dysfunction requiring dialysis at hospital discharge or day 28, whichever comes first. The primary outcome was analyzed as a per-protocol analysis. The trial monitored adherence closely as adherence to the transfusion triggers is important in ensuring that measured outcomes reflect the transfusion strategy. CONCLUSION: By randomizing prior to surgery, the TRICS III trial captured the most acute reduction in hemoglobin during cardiopulmonary bypass.",2018,United States,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2017.10.036,"{""pmid"": 29273477, ""electronic_issn"": ""1532-8422"", ""linking_issn"": ""1053-0770"", ""nlm_status"": ""MEDLINE"", ""nlm_journal_id"": ""9110208"", ""publication_types"": [""Journal Article"", ""Multicenter Study"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial"", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""], ""descriptors"": [{""descriptor"": ""Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Blood Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Erythrocyte Transfusion"", ""qualifier"": ""methods"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Female"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Hemoglobins"", ""qualifier"": ""metabolism"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Humans"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Internationality"", ""major"": true}, {""descriptor"": ""Male"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Middle Aged"", ""major"": false}, {""descriptor"": ""Pilot Projects"", ""major"": false}], ""keywords"": [""cardiac surgery"", ""randomized controlled trial"", ""transfusion""], ""language"": ""eng"", ""publication_status"": ""ppublish"", ""publication_date"": ""2018 Feb"", ""dates"": {""received"": ""2017-09-30"", ""published"": ""2017-12-24"", ""electronic"": ""2017-11-03""}}"

The influences on coagulopathy and bleeding tendency in severely injured patients (SIP) with concomitant traumatic brain injury are most widely unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the effect of mild IH in SIP with concomitant severe traumatic brain injuries on transfusion rate and mortality. Methods: In this retrospective multi-centre study, SIP from three European level-1 trauma centres with an ISS ≥16 between 2009 and 2011 were included. At hospital A, patients qualified for IH with age ≤70 years and a severe head injury with an abbreviated injury scale (AISHead) of ≥3. IH was defined as target core body temperature of 35 °C. Hypothermic patients were matched with two patients, one from hospital B and one from hospital C using age and AISHead. The effect of IH on the transfusion rate, complications and mortality was quantified with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Patients not treated with IH in hospital A and those from hospital B and C, who were not matched, were used to adjust the CI for the effect of inter-hospital therapy protocol differences. Results: Mean age of patients in the IH-group (n = 43) was 35.7 years, mean ISS 30 points and sex distribution showed 83.7 % male. Mean age of matched patients in the normotherm-group (n = 86) was 36.7 years, mean ISS 33 points and there were 75.6 % males. For the hypothermic patients, we pointed out an estimate of mean difference for the number of transfused units of packed red blood cells as well as for mortality which does not indicate a decrease in the benefit gained by hypothermia. It is suggested that hypothermic patients tend to a higher rate of lung failure and thromboembolisms. Conclusion: Though tending to an increased rate of complications, there is no evidence for a difference in both; rate of transfusion and mortality in SIP. Mild IH as an option for severe head injuries seems as well-being practicable in the presence of multiple severe injuries.

Between 40% and 50% of all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) receive at least one red blood cell (RBC) unit and average close to five RBC units during their ICU admission. For the critically ill patient, the risk of a blood transfusion-transmitted infection is not the major concern. What is of more consequence is the accumulating evidence that blood transfusion has profound negative effects on the immune system. On the other hand, there is little evidence that ""routine"" transfusion of stored allogeneic RBCs is beneficial to critically ill patients. It is clear that most critically ill patients can tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 7 mg/dL, and therefore a more conservative approach to RBC transfusion is warranted. The anemia of critical illness is a distinct clinical entity characterized by a blunted erythopoietin (EPO) production and abnormalities in iron metabolism identical to what is commonly referred to as the anemia of chronic disease. As such, the bone marrow in many of these patients responds to the administration of exogenous EPO, in spite of their critical illness. The efficacy of perioperative recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) has been demonstrated in a variety of elective surgical settings. Similarly, in critically ill patients with multiple organ failure, r-HuEPO therapy will also stimulate erythropoiesis. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, therapy with rHuEPO resulted in a significant reduction in RBC transfusions. Despite receiving fewer RBC transfusions, patients in the rHuEPO group had a significantly greater increase in hematocrit.",2003/07//,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 351 West Camden Street, MD 21201-2436",['https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rsm.ac.uk?url=/docview/696255675?accountid=138535'],"{""accession_number"": ""696255675; 36870315"", ""type_of_reference"": ""JOUR"", ""type_of_work"": ""Review"", ""keywords"": [""Blood transfusion"", ""Erythropoietin"", ""Transfusion practice"", ""Transfusion risks"", ""erythropoietin"", ""11096-26-7"", ""hemoglobin"", ""9008-02-0"", ""recombinant erythropoietin"", ""113427-24-0"", ""122312-54-3"", ""130455-76-4"", ""Embase"", ""24:Anesthesiology"", ""15:Chest Diseases, Thoracic Surgery and Tuberculosis"", ""25:Hematology"", ""37:Drug Literature Index"", ""multiple organ failure -- complication"", ""hospital admission"", ""anemia -- drug therapy"", ""critical illness"", ""surgical risk"", ""hemoglobin -- endogenous compound"", ""hematocrit"", ""laboratory test"", ""iron metabolism"", ""treatment planning"", ""review"", ""immune system"", ""erythropoiesis"", ""human"", ""blood transfusion"", ""elective surgery"", ""intensive care"", ""perioperative period"", ""risk factor"", ""bone marrow"", ""disease association"", ""anemia -- therapy"", ""erythrocyte transfusion"", ""infection risk"", ""erythropoietin -- endogenous compound"", ""chronic disease"", ""recombinant erythropoietin -- drug therapy"", ""anemia -- diagnosis""], ""issn"": ""10680640"", ""language"": ""ENG"", ""author_address"": "", One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, United States howard.l.corwin@hitchcock.org, , One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, United States, Corwin, H.L., , One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, United States"", ""database"": ""Embase®"", ""notes"": [""Copyright - Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."", ""Date created - 2003-07-29"", ""Date revised - 2012-10-20"", ""Number of references - 89"", ""Last updated - 2016-11-01"", ""CODEN - CPMEF""], ""attachments"": ""https://vw4tb4ff7s.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Aembase&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=unknown&rft.jtitle=Clinical+Pulmonary+Medicine&rft.atitle=Anemia%2C+blood+transfusion%2C+and+erythropoietin+in+the+critically+ill&rft.au=Corwin%2C+Howard+L.&rft.aulast=Corwin&rft.aufirst=Howard&rft.date=2003-07-01&rft.volume=10&rft.issue=4&rft.spage=219&rft.isbn=&rft.btitle=&rft.title=Clinical+Pulmonary+Medicine&rft.issn=10680640&rft_id=info:doi/"", ""date"": ""Jul 2003""}"
