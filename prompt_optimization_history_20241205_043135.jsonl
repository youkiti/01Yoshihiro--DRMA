We will not apply language or country restrictions. We will include all papers including published, unpublished articles, abstracts of conferences, and letters. We will exclude randomized cross-over or case series studies. We will not exclude studies based on the observation period or publication year.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudy\nSince we are interested in the association between the amount of transfusion and the acquirement of infection in critically ill patients, we will include studies to evaluate the transfusion for critically ill patients.\n\nAdditionally, since it has reached no consensus whether erythropoietin and iron supplementation affect infection in critically ill patients [4], we will also collect the amounts of transfusion reported in these studies. Whilst, in studies for pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will exclude vitamin D since vitamin D may inhibit sepsis in critically ill patients [5]. For the search for studies of pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will use the search strategies for the systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the hierarchy of monotherapy and combination therapy to reduce RBC transfusion for patients in the ICU [4].\n\nPopulation\n\nWe will include critically ill adult patients with hemodynamically stable, who are admitted to the ICU. Elective surgical patients and burn patients will be excluded.\n\nIntervention\nTo evaluate dose-response relationships, it needs that there is the difference of the amount of transfusion between the arms of these studies. Such interventions will be two or more different fixed doses of transfusion within a study and include the no-transfusion group that the amount of transfusion is 0 unit.\n\n\nOutcome\nIncidence of infection\nWe defined the incidence of infection as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are infections acquired in hospitals where critically ill patients are admitted and newly developed apart from the underlying disease [6]. HAIs cover bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, not parasitic [7]. We will measure the number of patients with HAIs during hospitalization. If the HAIs are not reported, we will collect the ICU-acquired infection. The collected data prioritizes pre-defined infection in each eligible study. In addition, we will collect the category of infection by the following hierarchy: i) Sepsis/Septic shock, ii) Bacteremia, iii) Any infection collected by the original authors.\n\n", "analysis": "The current prompt has an accuracy of 100% and specificity of 100%, but the sensitivity is 0%, indicating it is not recognizing any true positives.

We sought to determine whether a predictive model could be constructed that would serve as a useful decision support tool for the pre-emptive management of intensive care unit (ICU)-related anemia. METHODS: Our cohort consisted of all ICU patients (n = 5,170) admitted to a large tertiary-care academic medical center during the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. We divided the cohort into development (n = 3,619) and validation (n = 1,551) sets. Using a set of demographic and physiologic variables available within six hours of ICU admission, we developed models to predict patients who either received late transfusion or developed late anemia. We then constructed a point system to quantify, within six hours of ICU admission, the likelihood of developing late anemia. RESULTS: Models showed good discrimination with receiver operating characteristic curve areas ranging from 0.72 to 0.77, although predicting late transfusion was consistently less accurate than predicting late anemia. A five-item point system predicted likelihood of late anemia as well as existing clinical trial inclusion criteria but resulted in pre-emptive intervention more than two days earlier. CONCLUSION: A rule-based decision support tool using information available within six hours of ICU admission may lead to earlier and more appropriate use of blood-sparing strategies.", "should_be": "excluded", "was": "included"}]}
