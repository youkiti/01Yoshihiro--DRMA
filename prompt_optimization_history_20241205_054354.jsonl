Adverse effects of FFP have been well described, including acute lung injury. However, it is also suggested that a higher amount of FFP decreases mortality in trauma patients requiring a massive transfusion. Furthermore, FFP has an endothelial stabilizing effect in experimental models. We investigated the effect of fresh frozen plasma transfusion on systemic inflammation and endothelial condition. METHODS: A prospective predefined substudy of a randomized trial in coagulopathic non-bleeding critically ill patients receiving a prophylactic transfusion of FFP (12 ml/kg) prior to an invasive procedure. Levels of inflammatory cytokines and markers of endothelial condition were measured in paired samples of 33 patients before and after transfusion. The statistical tests used were paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: At baseline, systemic cytokine levels were mildly elevated in critically ill patients. FFP transfusion resulted in a decrease of levels of TNF-α (from 11.3 to 2.3 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Other cytokines were not affected. FFP also resulted in a decrease in systemic syndecan-1 levels (from 675 to 565 pg/ml, P = 0.01) and a decrease in factor VIII levels (from 246 to 246%, P <0.01), suggestive of an improved endothelial condition. This was associated with an increase in ADAMTS13 levels (from 24 to 32%, P <0.01) and a concomitant decrease in von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels (from 474 to 423%, P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A fixed dose of FFP transfusion in critically ill patients decreases syndecan-1 and factor VIII levels, suggesting a stabilized endothelial condition, possibly by increasing ADAMTS13, which is capable of cleaving vWF.

In AI, iron metabolism is altered, as high levels of inflammation-induced hepcidin reduces the amount of iron that is available for erythropoiesis. AI is treated by red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. It is known that RBC transfusions increase iron level in neonates and thalassemia patients, but the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism during inflammatory processes is unknown. Since one unit of RBCs contains 220 mg of iron and 25% of the RBCs are cleared by macrophages within 1 hour following transfusion, RBC transfusion could increase iron levels and iron availability for erythropoiesis. We investigated the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism in ICU patients, and additionally compared the effect in septic patients to non-septic patients. Study Design/Method: In a prospective cohort study in 52 ICU patients who received one RBC transfusion, different iron parameters were measured before and 24 hours after transfusion, to determine the effect of a RBC transfusion over a period of time. Next, the impact of a RBC transfusion on plasma iron parameters in septic patients compared to that in non-septic patients was analyzed. Plasma iron concentration, transferrin (saturation), ferritin, haptoglobin, hepcidin and IL-6 levels were determined. Results/Finding: In this cohort, serum iron levels were low and did not change following transfusion (4.1 vs. 4.3 mmol/L, p=0.69). Also, the transfusion had no effect on transferrin saturation (12 vs. 13 %, p=0.13), ferritin (531.0 vs. 599.0 mg/L, p=0.74) and IL-6 levels (35.0 vs. 25.5 pg/ml, p=0.09). Hepcidin levels increased in these ICU patients after RBC transfusion (223 vs 332 ng/ml, p=0.01). In septic patients, RBC transfusion induced a decrease in haptoglobin levels compared to baseline, which did not occur in non-septic patients (-2.7 vs. 3.7 % change, p=0.05). Other iron parameters did not differ between septic and non-septic patients. Conclusion: Transfusion of one unit of RBCs does not increase iron levels in ICU patients. The increase of hepcidin suggests RBC transfusion induced upregulation of hepcidin, despite the absence of a significant increase in IL- 6 or plasma iron levels. This increase in hepcidin levels after transfusion can potentially further hamper iron availability for erythropoiesis. In sepsis, RBC transfusion decreases haptoglobin levels, suggestive of hemolysis.

A cohort of 3037 consecutive surgical cases requiring intensive care therapy for more than one day was analyzed.

After controlling for the additional effect of variables reflecting organ dysfunction during ICU stay, we found that red cell transfusion was no longer an independent risk factor for death.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduce a new method to assess transfusion practice based on decision time intervals (DTIs). Each patient's intensive care (ICU) stay was segmented into a series of DTIs defined by a time interval following results of a complete blood count (CBC). We studied the presence of 17 clinical factors during each DTI whether transfusion was given or not. We used a generalized linear mixed model to assess the most influential clinical triggers for platelet transfusion. RESULTS: Among 6125 ICU patients treated between October 2016 and October 2021, we analyzed 39,745 DTIs among patients (n = 2921) who had at least one DTI with thrombocytopenia (≤150,000/μL). We found no association between platelet count and two markers of bleeding: drop in hemoglobin and chest tube drainage. We found that the majority of DTIs were associated with no platelet transfusion regardless of the platelet count; that no specific platelet value triggered transfusion; but rather that multiple clinical factors in conjunction with the platelet count influenced the decision to transfuse.

The literature is sparse on the outcomes of critically ill patients with TTP managed in intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to determine the mortality of ICU patients admitted with TTP and evaluate the predictors of survival. We also compared the incidence of nosocomial infection among those who did or did not receive plasma exchange (PE). Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary ICU. Two authors screened patients for eligibility from the hospital information system based on peripheral smear reports. Adult critically ill TTP patients managed in ICU were included. Patients with a diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, autoimmune causes of haemolysis and pregnancy-related conditions, etc. were excluded. Two authors extracted data from medical charts. No imputation of missing variables was done. Non-parametric statistics were used to report data. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16. Results Of the 535 records that were screened, 33 patients were deemed eligible. Mortality among TTP patients was 14 (42%). The women to men ratio was 7:3. At admission, greater degree of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors (5.4 g/dl [4.8-7.1] v. 7.6 g/dl [6.1-8.9], p=0.05; 17x103 μl v. 21x103 μl, p=0.63; and 2987 (1904-3614) U/L v. 2126 U/L (1941-3319), p=0.71; respectively]. Nineteen (57%) patients had acute kidney injury (AKI), of which 11 survived: 6 recovered completely from renal failure and 5 progressed to end-stage renal disease. Nosocomial infection rates were not different among those receiving and not receiving PE therapy (7 [33%] v. 3 [25%], respectively). Conclusion TTP is more common in women and has a high mortality.

However, these cohort studies did not adjust for disease severity during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study using prospectively collected data from March 1, 1993, through February 28, 2005. A cohort of 3037 consecutive surgical cases requiring intensive care therapy for more than one day was analyzed. We used two different sets of potentially confounding covariables (admission variables only or in combination with variables reflecting number and extent of organ dysfunction during ICU stay). We found that the total number of red cell units which a case had received during ICU stay, and the maximum number of units given on a single day, were independently associated with an increase in ICU mortality when only admission variables were considered for the analysis. After controlling for the additional effect of variables reflecting organ dysfunction during ICU stay, we found that red cell transfusion was no longer an independent risk factor for death. However, there was a significant effect of red cell transfusion on ICU LOS in survivors irrespective of the covariable sets used. We conclude that red cell transfusion during ICU stay may be only a surrogate marker for disease severity and is not causally related to ICU mortality.

Adverse effects of FFP have been well described, including acute lung injury. However, it is also suggested that a higher amount of FFP decreases mortality in trauma patients requiring a massive transfusion. Furthermore, FFP has an endothelial stabilizing effect in experimental models. We investigated the effect of fresh frozen plasma transfusion on systemic inflammation and endothelial condition. METHODS: A prospective predefined substudy of a randomized trial in coagulopathic non-bleeding critically ill patients receiving a prophylactic transfusion of FFP (12 ml/kg) prior to an invasive procedure. Levels of inflammatory cytokines and markers of endothelial condition were measured in paired samples of 33 patients before and after transfusion. The statistical tests used were paired t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: At baseline, systemic cytokine levels were mildly elevated in critically ill patients. FFP transfusion resulted in a decrease of levels of TNF-α (from 11.3 to 2.3 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Other cytokines were not affected. FFP also resulted in a decrease in systemic syndecan-1 levels (from 675 to 565 pg/ml, P = 0.01) and a decrease in factor VIII levels (from 246 to 246%, P <0.01), suggestive of an improved endothelial condition. This was associated with an increase in ADAMTS13 levels (from 24 to 32%, P <0.01) and a concomitant decrease in von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels (from 474 to 423%, P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A fixed dose of FFP transfusion in critically ill patients decreases syndecan-1 and factor VIII levels, suggesting a stabilized endothelial condition, possibly by increasing ADAMTS13, which is capable of cleaving vWF.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether FFP and PC storage duration is associated with increased in hospital mortality risk across cardiac surgery, acute medicine, ICU and orthopaedic surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-stage individual patient data meta-analyses were performed to determine the effects of FFP and PC storage duration on in hospital mortality. Preset random effects models were used to determine pooled unadjusted and adjusted (adjusted for age, gender and units of product transfused) effect estimates. RESULTS: The FFP storage duration analysis included 3625 patients across four studies. No significant association was observed between duration of storage and in hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis, but after adjusting for patient age, gender and units of product a small increased risk of in hospital mortality was observed for each additional month of storage (OR: 1·05, 95% CI: 1·01-1·08). This effect was no longer statistically significant when donor ABO blood group was incorporated into the random effects model on post hoc analyses. A total of 547 patients across five studies were incorporated in the PC storage duration analysis. No association was observed between PC storage duration and odds of in hospital morality (adjusted OR: 0·94, 95% CI: 0·79-1·11).

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduce a new method to assess transfusion practice based on decision time intervals (DTIs). Each patient's intensive care (ICU) stay was segmented into a series of DTIs defined by a time interval following results of a complete blood count (CBC). We studied the presence of 17 clinical factors during each DTI whether transfusion was given or not. We used a generalized linear mixed model to assess the most influential clinical triggers for platelet transfusion. RESULTS: Among 6125 ICU patients treated between October 2016 and October 2021, we analyzed 39,745 DTIs among patients (n = 2921) who had at least one DTI with thrombocytopenia (≤150,000/μL). We found no association between platelet count and two markers of bleeding: drop in hemoglobin and chest tube drainage. We found that the majority of DTIs were associated with no platelet transfusion regardless of the platelet count; that no specific platelet value triggered transfusion; but rather that multiple clinical factors in conjunction with the platelet count influenced the decision to transfuse. DISCUSSION: DTI analysis represents a new method to assess transfusion practice that considers both transfusions given and not given, and that analyzes clinical circumstances present when decisions regarding transfusion are made.

Patients with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival on the hospital (T-CPA) usually suffered from lethal hemorrhage and required rapid supplement of red blood cells for resuscitation of circulation and oxygen transport, that is to say BTT. However, the prognosis of T-CPA patients is well known hopeless. The aim of this study is to evaluate the propriety of our strategy concerning BTT for T-CPA patients. SUBJETCS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the medical records of T-CPA patients for the past 10 years. We do BTT until 1998 (the first period) for T-CPA patients regardless of ROSC without any restriction. After then (the second period), we do BTT case by case but only after ROSC in principle. The rate of ROSC, admission to ICU, survive to discharge were compared between these two period, and were compared within the first period between the patients group who underwent BTT (BTT group) and the group who did not underwent BTT (non-BTT group). RESULTS: In 477 blunt T-CPA and 29 penetrating T-CPA patients, 34 and 59% achieved ROSC, 18 and 38% admitted to ICU, and 3 and 14% were survive to discharge. In penetrating T-CPA in the first period, 12 units of packed red cells (PRC) were used before ROSC for 1 non-survivors. In the second period, no PRC was used for non-survivor before ROSC. In blunt T-CPA in the first period, PRCs were used for 29 non-survivors before ROSC. In the second period no PRC was used for non-survivors before ROSC. Concerning the effect of BTT on the prognosis of T-CPA in all cases, the rate of ROSC and admission to ICU were statistically higher in the first period than in the second period (p = 0.0003 and 0.032).
