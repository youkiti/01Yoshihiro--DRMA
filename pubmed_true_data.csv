30871608,Transfusion requirements after head trauma: a randomized feasibility controlled trial.,Anemia is frequent among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with an increased risk of poor outcome. The optimal hemoglobin concentration to trigger red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with TBI is not clearly defined.

28906284,Effect of Transfusion on Mortality and Other Adverse Events Among Critically Ill Septic Patients: An Observational Study Using a Marginal Structural Cox Model.,"RBC transfusion is often required in patients with sepsis. However, adverse events have been associated with RBC transfusion, raising safety concerns. A randomized controlled trial validated the 7â€‰g/dL threshold, but previously transfused patients were excluded. Cohort studies led to conflicting results and did not handle time-dependent covariates and history of treatment. Additional data are thus warranted to guide patient's management."
21192282,Transfusion-related risk of secondary bacterial infections in sepsis patients: a retrospective cohort study.,"There is a need for insight into factors that contribute to late mortality of sepsis patients. Immunomodulatory effects have been ascribed to blood transfusion. This retrospective cohort study investigates the association between the development of nosocomial bacterial infection and transfusion of leukodepleted red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets (PLTs) in survivors of the initial phase of sepsis. Patients diagnosed with sepsis after admission to the intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital were included. Of 134 patients with sepsis, 67 received a blood transfusion (50%). A secondary infection developed in 19 patients (14%). A multiple logistic regression model revealed that the use of immunosuppressive medication with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.31), but not Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, malignancy, HIV infection, alcohol abuse, or diabetes mellitus, was a risk factor for nosocomial infection. In an adjusted model, the amount of transfused RBCs was associated with secondary infection with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01-1.37). Storage time of RBCs was a relevant confounder of the effect of the amount of RBCs on infection, with an adjusted OR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04-1.51), P = 0.02. Also, the amount of transfused PLTs was associated with secondary infection, with an OR of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.05-1.78). In conclusion, transfusion of RBCs and PLTs is associated with the onset of secondary bacterial infection in sepsis patients. Storage time of RBCs influences this increased risk. These findings suggest that immunomodulatory effects of blood transfusion contribute to adverse outcome in the convalescent phase of sepsis."
33591005,Impact of Blood Product Transfusions on the Risk of ICU-Acquired Infections in Septic Shock.,Transfusions of blood products are common in critically ill patients and have a potential for immunomodulation. The aim of this study is to address the impact of transfusion of blood products on the susceptibility to ICU-acquired infections in the high-risk patients with septic shock.

18442375,"Anemia, transfusions and hospital outcomes among critically ill patients on prolonged acute mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study.","Patients requiring prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) represent one-third of those who need mechanical ventilation, but they utilize two-thirds of hospital resources devoted to mechanical ventilation. Measures are needed to optimize the efficiency of care in this population. Both duration of intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation are associated with anemia and increased rates of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion. We hypothesized that transfusions among patients receiving PAMV are common and associated with worsened clinical and economic outcomes."
27436190,"Transfusion of platelets, but not of red blood cells, is independently associated with nosocomial infections in the critically ill.","Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been associated with nosocomial infection in the critically ill patients. However, this association may be confounded by length of stay, as prolonged intensive care unit (ICU stay) increases both risk of infection and risk of transfusion. Also, it is not known whether specific blood products have differential risks."
