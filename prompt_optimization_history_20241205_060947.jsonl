We will not apply language or country restrictions. We will include all papers including published, unpublished articles, abstracts of conferences, and letters. We will exclude randomized cross-over or case series studies. We will not exclude studies based on the observation period or publication year.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudy\nSince we are interested in the association between the amount of transfusion and the acquirement of infection in critically ill patients, we will include studies to evaluate the transfusion for critically ill patients.\n\nAdditionally, since it has reached no consensus whether erythropoietin and iron supplementation affect infection in critically ill patients [4], we will also collect the amounts of transfusion reported in these studies. Whilst, in studies for pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will exclude vitamin D since vitamin D may inhibit sepsis in critically ill patients [5]. For the search for studies of pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will use the search strategies for the systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the hierarchy of monotherapy and combination therapy to reduce RBC transfusion for patients in the ICU [4].\n\nPopulation\n\nWe will include critically ill adult patients with hemodynamically stable, who are admitted to the ICU. Elective surgical patients and burn patients will be excluded.\n\nIntervention\nTo evaluate dose-response relationships, it needs that there is the difference of the amount of transfusion between the arms of these studies. Such interventions will be two or more different fixed doses of transfusion within a study and include the no-transfusion group that the amount of transfusion is 0 unit.\n\n\nOutcome\nIncidence of infection\nWe defined the incidence of infection as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are infections acquired in hospitals where critically ill patients are admitted and newly developed apart from the underlying disease [6]. HAIs cover bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, not parasitic [7]. We will measure the number of patients with HAIs during hospitalization. If the HAIs are not reported, we will collect the ICU-acquired infection. The collected data prioritizes pre-defined infection in each eligible study. In addition, we will collect the category of infection by the following hierarchy: i) Sepsis/Septic shock, ii) Bacteremia, iii) Any infection collected by the original authors.\n\n", "analysis": "The current prompt has a high specificity but low sensitivity, indicating it accurately identifies articles that do not meet the criteria but misses many that do.

Neverthless, RBC transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Restrictive strategy policy, based on a haemoglobin [Hb] level of 7 g dL, is the guideline to transfuse most of ICU patients. The aim of RBC transfusion is to avoid tissue hypoxia by improving oxygen delivery (DO2) and therefore oxygen consumption (VO2). This could suggest to combine [Hb] and some parameters reflecting the sytemic DO2 VO2 balance to decide to transfuse. This study aims to analyse the effects of RBC transfusion on the systemic oxygenation assessed by the (central) venous oxygen saturation (S(c) VO2), the lactate level, the venous-to-arterial carbon dioxyde pressure gradient (Pv-aCO2) and the ratio between cardiac index and O2 extraction (IC EO2), and to assess their usefulness in the transfusion decision. Patients and methods: During 9 months, all adult patients transfused in the ICU of CHU-Charleroi Marie Curie were included except patients with active bleeding or without jugular or subclavicular catheter. The systemic oxygenation parameters have been measured before and after transfusion. Patients a priori have been grouped according to their initial S(c)VO2 (< or > 70%), to their cardiac (< or > 50% of a left ventricular ejection fraction) and septic status. The results are expressed in median and interquartile ranges. Comparisons were made by a Wilcoxon test. Results: 86 RBC transfusions were made on 53 patients. For all patients, mean arterial pressure, [Hb] and S(c)VO2 increased significantly after transfusion ([Hb]: 7.4 [7-7.8] to 8.3 [7.7-8.8] g dL; MAP: 79 [69-90] to 82 [74-92] mmHg and S(c)VO2: 66 [60-73] to 69 [63-75] %; for all p < 0.001). Only patients with an initial S(c)VO2 < 70% improved it after transfusion (62 [58-65] to 66 [62-71] %; p < 0.001). The Pv-aCO2 was significantly higher in patients with an initial S(c)VO2 < 70% (8 [5-10] mmHg) but did not change after transfusion as [lactate] and IC EO2. These results are maintained whatever the cardiac or septic status. Conclusion: A S(c)VO2 < 70% in anemic ICU patients compared to other systemic oxygenation parameters, seems to be useful to assess the transfusion requirement as indicator of a DO2 VO2 imbalance. It should be interesting to combine it with the [Hb] in the decision to transfuse anemic critically ill patient.", "should_be": "excluded", "was": "included"}, {"type": "false_positive", "title": "The effect of red blood cell transfusion on iron metabolism in critically ill patients", "abstract": "Background/Case Studies: Anemia of Inflammation (AI) has a high prevalence in critically ill patients. In AI, iron metabolism is altered, as high levels of inflammation-induced hepcidin reduces the amount of iron that is available for erythropoiesis. AI is treated by red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. It is known that RBC transfusions increase iron level in neonates and thalassemia patients, but the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism during inflammatory processes is unknown. Since one unit of RBCs contains 220 mg of iron and 25% of the RBCs are cleared by macrophages within 1 hour following transfusion, RBC transfusion could increase iron levels and iron availability for erythropoiesis. We investigated the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism in ICU patients, and additionally compared the effect in septic patients to non-septic patients. Study Design/Method: In a prospective cohort study in 52 ICU patients who received one RBC transfusion, different iron parameters were measured before and 24 hours after transfusion, to determine the effect of a RBC transfusion over a period of time. Next, the impact of a RBC transfusion on plasma iron parameters in septic patients compared to that in non-septic patients was analyzed. Plasma iron concentration, transferrin (saturation), ferritin, haptoglobin, hepcidin and IL-6 levels were determined. Results/Finding: In this cohort, serum iron levels were low and did not change following transfusion (4.1 vs. 4.3 mmol/L, p=0.69). Also, the transfusion had no effect on transferrin saturation (12 vs. 13 %, p=0.13), ferritin (531.0 vs. 599.0 mg/L, p=0.74) and IL-6 levels (35.0 vs. 25.5 pg/ml, p=0.09). Hepcidin levels increased in these ICU patients after RBC transfusion (223 vs 332 ng/ml, p=0.01). In septic patients, RBC transfusion induced a decrease in haptoglobin levels compared to baseline, which did not occur in non-septic patients (-2.7 vs. 3.7 % change, p=0.05). Other iron parameters did not differ between septic and non-septic patients. Conclusion: Transfusion of one unit of RBCs does not increase iron levels in ICU patients. The increase of hepcidin suggests RBC transfusion induced upregulation of hepcidin, despite the absence of a significant increase in IL- 6 or plasma iron levels. This increase in hepcidin levels after transfusion can potentially further hamper iron availability for erythropoiesis. In sepsis, RBC transfusion decreases haptoglobin levels, suggestive of hemolysis. In conclusion, RBC transfusion might have a negative effect on erythropoiesis, due to the increase in hepcidin levels that are observed after transfusion.", "should_be": "excluded", "was": "included"}, {"type": "false_negative", "title": "Blood transfusion for traumatic cardiac arrest", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Blood transfusion therapy (BTT) is thought as one of transplantation of living cell, that means BTT includes several risk such as infection and BTT should be thought to derived from precious material by courtesy of donors. Patients with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival on the hospital (T-CPA) usually suffered from lethal hemorrhage and required rapid supplement of red blood cells for resuscitation of circulation and oxygen transport, that is to say BTT. However, the prognosis of T-CPA patients is well known hopeless. The aim of this study is to evaluate the propriety of our strategy concerning BTT for T-CPA patients. SUBJETCS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the medical records of T-CPA patients for the past 10 years. We do BTT until 1998 (the first period) for T-CPA patients regardless of ROSC without any restriction. After then (the second period), we do BTT case by case but only after ROSC in principle. The rate of ROSC, admission to ICU, survive to discharge were compared between these two period, and were compared within the first period between the patients group who underwent BTT (BTT group) and the group who did not underwent BTT (non-BTT group). RESULTS: In 477 blunt T-CPA and 29 penetrating T-CPA patients, 34 and 59% achieved ROSC, 18 and 38% admitted to ICU, and 3 and 14% were survive to discharge. In penetrating T-CPA in the first period, 12 units of packed red cells (PRC) were used before ROSC for 1 non-survivors. In the second period, no PRC was used for non-survivor before ROSC. In blunt T-CPA in the first period, PRCs were used for 29 non-survivors before ROSC. In the second period no PRC was used for non-survivors before ROSC. Concerning the effect of BTT on the prognosis of T-CPA in all cases, the rate of ROSC and admission to ICU were statistically higher in the first period than in the second period (p = 0.0003 and 0.032). However, there was no statistical difference in the rate of survive-to-discharge between these periods. There was a same tendency in witnessed cases. In cases with electrical rhythm on the scene, only the rate of ROSC were higher in the first period (p = 0.007). Restricted in the first period, only the rate of ROSC was statistically higher in non-BTT group than BTT group in all cases, in witnessed cases, and in cases with electrical rhythm on the scene (p = 0.005, 0.008, and 0.003). However, there was no statistical difference in the rate of admission to ICU and survive-to-discharge between these groups.. CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective serial study showed a possibility that BTT before ROSC for T-CPA improves the success rate of ROSC but add no effect on the improvement of survival rate.

In this quality improvement intervention we assessed the effect of an institutional protocol and computerized decision support for red cell transfusion in the critically ill. DESIGN: We compared processes of care and outcomes during the two 3-month periods before and after the introduction of a multidisciplinary quality improvement intervention. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care units--medical, surgical, and mixed--in a tertiary academic center. PATIENTS: Consecutive critically ill patients with anemia (hemoglobin of <10 g/dL). INTERVENTION: Using the computerized provider order entry, we developed an evidence-based decision algorithm for red cell transfusion in adult intensive care units. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected information on demographics, diagnosis, severity of illness, transfusion complications, and laboratory values. The main outcome measures were number of transfusions, proportion of patients who were transfused outside evidence-based indications, transfusion complications, and adjusted hospital mortality. The mean number of red cell transfusions per intensive care unit admission decreased from 1.08 +/- 2.3 units before to 0.86 +/- 2.3 units after the protocol (p<.001). We observed a marked decrease in the percentage of patients receiving inappropriate transfusions (17.7% vs. 4.5%, p< .001). The rate of transfusion complications was also lower in the period after the protocol (6.1% vs. 2.7%, p = .015). In the multivariate analysis, protocol introduction was associated with decreased likelihood of red cell transfusion (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.62). Adjusted hospital mortality did not differ before and after protocol implementation (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.8).
