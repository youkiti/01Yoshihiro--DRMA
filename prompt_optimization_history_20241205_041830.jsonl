We will not apply language or country restrictions. We will include all papers including published, unpublished articles, abstracts of conferences, and letters. We will exclude randomized cross-over or case series studies. We will not exclude studies based on the observation period or publication year.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudy\nSince we are interested in the association between the amount of transfusion and the acquirement of infection in critically ill patients, we will include studies to evaluate the transfusion for critically ill patients.\n\nAdditionally, since it has reached no consensus whether erythropoietin and iron supplementation affect infection in critically ill patients [4], we will also collect the amounts of transfusion reported in these studies. Whilst, in studies for pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will exclude vitamin D since vitamin D may inhibit sepsis in critically ill patients [5]. For the search for studies of pharmacotherapy for anemia, we will use the search strategies for the systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the hierarchy of monotherapy and combination therapy to reduce RBC transfusion for patients in the ICU [4].\n\nPopulation\n\nWe will include critically ill adult patients with hemodynamically stable, who are admitted to the ICU. Elective surgical patients and burn patients will be excluded.\n\nIntervention\nTo evaluate dose-response relationships, it needs that there is the difference of the amount of transfusion between the arms of these studies. Such interventions will be two or more different fixed doses of transfusion within a study and include the no-transfusion group that the amount of transfusion is 0 unit.\n\n\nOutcome\nIncidence of infection\nWe defined the incidence of infection as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are infections acquired in hospitals where critically ill patients are admitted and newly developed apart from the underlying disease [6]. HAIs cover bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, not parasitic [7]. We will measure the number of patients with HAIs during hospitalization. If the HAIs are not reported, we will collect the ICU-acquired infection. The collected data prioritizes pre-defined infection in each eligible study. In addition, we will collect the category of infection by the following hierarchy: i) Sepsis/Septic shock, ii) Bacteremia, iii) Any infection collected by the original authors.\n\n", "analysis": "The current prompt fails completely in terms of sensitivity (0%), meaning it does not detect any true positives. This is potentially because the inclusion criteria are either too narrow, not explicit enough, or perhaps misunderstood during the judgement of which studies should be included. Specificity sits at 100%, which means there are no false positives, indicating what it deems to not meet the criteria is consistently accurate. However, the lack of sensitivity is a major issue as the prompt cannot detect relevant articles correctly. As there are no error cases detailed, specific improvements are based on enhancing clarity and comprehensiveness of the criteria. It also appears that the criteria for evaluations are complex and nuanced, which might result in misinterpretation by users or systems interpreting this prompt. Moreover, key terms and conditions should be emphasized or rephrased to avoid misinterpretation.", "suggested_changes": "1. Simplify and clarify the inclusion criteria by breaking down complex criteria into simpler, distinct points.\n2. Highlight examples of studies that meet criteria, and list attributes that would automatically exclude a study.\n3. Include definitions or clarifications for critical terms or concepts (e.g., 'critically ill patients', 'dose-response relationship').\n4. Make criteria bullet point and specific, where possible, to avoid ambiguity.\n5. Create an accessible flow chart or decision aid to assist in decision-making whether a study should be included or excluded.", "metrics": {"sensitivity": 0, "specificity": 1.0, "accuracy": 1.0}, "error_cases": []}

Does the outcome relate to the incidence of infection?\nAffirmative answers lead towards inclusion, negatives suggest exclusion.", "analysis": "The current prompt is highly specific but not sensitive, which indicates it's correctly excluding non-relevant studies but failing to include all relevant ones. The low sensitivity score of 0.00% suggests that no relevant studies are being included, highlighting a stringent criteria application or a misalignment between criteria and relevant study features. The flowchart is useful but might be too rigid, possibly overlooking nuanced information that could qualify a study for inclusion. The prompt criteria are largely comprehensive but would benefit from further clarification or expansion, especially in the sections concerning the study population and interventions.", "suggested_changes": "1. Loosen the flow-chart structure by allowing room for expert judgment where criteria rigidity might exclude relevant studies. Ensure the criteria allow for small deviations if they otherwise meet the core inclusion needs.\n2. Modify the intervention criteria to consider indirect transfusion impact studies, as well as studies that may not strictly adhere to two different dose reports but provide valuable data nonetheless.\n3. Explicitly instruct reviewers to cross-reference key study elements with criteria and offer guidance for unclear cases, enabling reviewers to draw logical conclusions rather than strict adherence to yes/no decision flow.\n4. Clarify inclusion criteria for populations, emphasizing critical illness framing over specific clinical settings where applicable.\n5.
