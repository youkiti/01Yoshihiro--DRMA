The rates of early marginal ulcers have decreased from 3.48 to 2.37 per 1000 person/year from 2015 to 2021 in the United States. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with readmission due to MU within 30 days after RYGB and the postoperative 30-day outcomes of this cohort. Methods Patients who underwent RYGB and required readmission for Marginal Ulcer (MU) were identified using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database from 2015 to 2021. Those who had a reoperation, intervention, or readmission due to causes other than MU were excluded. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Among 302,612 patients undergoing RYGB, 631 (0.21%) required readmission due to MU. Among these cases, 89.5% (n=565) required an intervention: 79.5% (n=502) underwent an endoscopic procedure, 4.1% (n=26) required reoperation, and 5.9% (n=37) underwent both. Parameters independently associated with an increased risk for early readmission due to MU included being African American (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.61), current use of therapeutic anticoagulation (AOR, 1.81), or steroids/immunosuppressive drugs (AOR, 1.64), prolonged operative time (>120 min) (AOR, 1.20), and history of cardiac stenting (AOR, 2.85), deep vein thrombosis (AOR, 2.19), and renal insufficiency (AOR, 2.17) (Figure 1). Additionally, patients who had early MU reported significantly higher rates of postoperative complications such as cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications, blood transfusion requirement, unplanned ICU admission, venous thromboembolism, surgical site infection (SSI), and sepsis (p<0.05). Conclusion The incidence of early readmission for MU following RYGB was less than 1%. Most of these cases required an endoscopic intervention. Some patient-related factors and increased operative time contributed to an increased risk of early readmission due to MU.

To identify independent predictors for ARF onset in patients who underwent cervical TSCI without premorbid respiratory diseases and to apply appropriate medical supports based on accurate prediction, a nomogram relating admission clinical information was developed for predicting ARF during acute care period. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical profiles of patients who suffered cervical TSCI and were emergently admitted to Qingdao Municipal Hospital from 2014 to 2020 as the training cohort. Univariate analysis was performed using admission clinical variables to estimate associated factors and a nomogram for predicting ARF occurrence was generated based on the independent predictors from multivariate logistic regression analysis. This nomogram was assessed by concordance index for discrimination and calibration curve with internal-validated bootstrap strategy. Receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to compare the predictive accuracy between the nomogram and the traditional gold standard, which combines neuroimaging and neurological measurements by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An additional 56-patient cohort from another medical center was retrospectively reviewed as the test cohort for external validation of the nomogram. Results: 162 patients were eligible for this study and were included in the training cohort, among which 25 individuals developed ARF and were recorded to endure more complications. Despite the aggressive treatments and prolonged intensive care unit cares, 14 patients insulted with ARF died. Injury level, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade, admission hemoglobin (Hb), platelet to lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil percentage to albumin ratio (NPAR) were independently associated with ARF onset. The concordance index of the nomogram incorporating these predictors was 0.933 in the training cohort and 0.955 in the test cohort, although both calibrations were good. The AUC of the nomogram was equal to concordance index, which presented better predictive accuracy compared with previous measurements using neuroimaging and AIS grade (AUC 0.933 versus 0.821, Delong’s test p < 0.001). Similar significant results were also found in the test cohort (AUC 0.955 versus 0.765, Delong’s test p = 0.034). In addition, this nomogram was translated to a Web-based calculator that could generate individual probability for ARF in a visualized form. Conclusions: The nomogram incorporating the injury level, AIS grade, admission Hb, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, and NPAR is a promising model to predict ARF in patients with cervical TSCI who are absent from previous respiratory dysfunction. This nomogram can be offered to clinicians to stratify patients, strengthen evidence-based decision-making, and apply appropriate individualized treatment in the field of acute clinical care.", "should_be": "excluded", "was": "included"}, {"type": "false_positive", "title": "Predicting late anemia in critical illness.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Identifying critically ill patients most likely to benefit from pre-emptive therapies will become increasingly important if therapies are to be used safely and cost-effectively. We sought to determine whether a predictive model could be constructed that would serve as a useful decision support tool for the pre-emptive management of intensive care unit (ICU)-related anemia. METHODS: Our cohort consisted of all ICU patients (n = 5,170) admitted to a large tertiary-care academic medical center during the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. We divided the cohort into development (n = 3,619) and validation (n = 1,551) sets. Using a set of demographic and physiologic variables available within six hours of ICU admission, we developed models to predict patients who either received late transfusion or developed late anemia. We then constructed a point system to quantify, within six hours of ICU admission, the likelihood of developing late anemia. RESULTS: Models showed good discrimination with receiver operating characteristic curve areas ranging from 0.72 to 0.77, although predicting late transfusion was consistently less accurate than predicting late anemia. A five-item point system predicted likelihood of late anemia as well as existing clinical trial inclusion criteria but resulted in pre-emptive intervention more than two days earlier. CONCLUSION: A rule-based decision support tool using information available within six hours of ICU admission may lead to earlier and more appropriate use of blood-sparing strategies.", "should_be": "excluded", "was": "included"}]}

Higher all-cause mortality occurred in neonates without NEC who were non-O compared with O (HR = 17.5; 95% CI: 1.784–171.692), but not in neonates with NEC (HR = 1.112; 95% CI: 0.142–8.841).

Study design and methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in VLBW neonates in neonatal intensive care units between 2004 and 2016. VLBW (≤1500 grams) neonates were followed until discharge or in-hospital death. The primary exposure was ABO group. Secondary exposures included platelet count, plasma transfusions, and maternal ABO group. Outcome measures were NEC (defined as Bell stage ≥ 2) and all-cause mortality. Time-dependent Cox regression models with competing risks were used to investigate factors associated with NEC and mortality.
